## Appendix A: Formal Core


The Key Mathematical Equations and Structures of FRC

Purpose: This appendix provides a provisional formalization of the core
mathematical and algorithmic structures used throughout this work. These
equations are designed to anchor the narrative concepts in a
quantitative framework, enabling simulation, experimental design, and
further theoretical development.

Notation: Scalars are italic (S, P, τ), vectors are bold (x), and
operators are denoted with a hat (Ĥ). μ-level indices are subscripts
(μ₀...μ₇).

A.0 The Foundational Law (FRC 566)

The entire FRC framework is anchored in the Entropy–Coherence
Reciprocity Law—the conservation principle that links disorder and
order:

$$\boxed{dS + k^* d\ln C = 0}$$

- dS: Change in Informational Entropy/Disorder.
- dln C: Change in Coherence Density (order, phase alignment).
- k^(*): The emergent Coherence Coupling Constant.

   RC-1  Formation Energy (Object Persistence)   $E_{\rm form} = \int \rho(\phi) \cdot C(\phi) \, d\phi$. Object stability is a function of minimizing entropy and maximizing local coherence C(ϕ) in phase space.                                                        Matter is a sustained resonance.
   RC-2  Resonant Collapse Amplification         A_(i)(t) = A_(i)(0) ⋅ e^(κ_(i) ⋅ t). Outcome i^(*) is the one with the highest amplification rate, κ_(i^(*)), determined by the resonant match with the environment.                                                     Collapse is deterministic amplification.
   RC-3  Born Rule Deviation                     $\Delta P_i \approx \varepsilon \cdot (\partial \kappa_i / \partial \theta) \mid_{\theta_{\rm res}}$. The prediction that a weak, tuned field (θ) can systematically bias quantum probability away from the Born Rule.   The core falsifiable claim.
   RC-4  Scale-Invariant Convergence Time        τ_(i) ≈ 1/(κ_(i) ⋅ ΔΦ_(i)). Convergence time (τ) is inversely proportional to amplification rate (κ) and internal coherence (ΔΦ⁻¹).                                                                                      Intelligence minimizes τ.

A.2 The μ-Level Stack & Will

   Code  Name                                                                                                                                    Equation / Description                                                                                                          Core Idea
  ------ ----------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------ -------------------------------
   RC-5  Global Coherence Scalar ($S_{\rm FRC}$)                              $S_{\rm FRC} = \sum_{\mu=0}^{7} w_{\mu} \cdot C_{\mu}$. The total coherence of a system is the weighted sum of the coherence (C) of its individual μ-levels.                               The measure of the Soul.
   RC-6  Cross-Level Influence                            W(μ_(i) → μ_(j)) ∝ (C_(μ_(i)) ⋅ Γ_(ij))/Δf_(ij). The mechanism for downward causation: higher-level coherence (C_(μ_(i))) constrains lower levels, inversely proportional to the frequency gap (Δf).              Downward Causation.
   RC-7  The Physics of Will                        $\boxed{\mathcal{W} = -\nabla S_{\rm FRC}}$. The Will (𝒲) is a physical vector field defined as the negative gradient of the global coherence scalar—the force driving a system toward greater internal harmony.   Will is a Coherence Gradient.
   RC-8  Decision Latency                                                                                                                    $T_{\rm decision} \propto 1 /                                                                                                      \mathcal{W}

   RC-9   General Resonance Gating Equation (GRGE)                                                                    $P(\text{access}                                                                    \text{state}) \approx N \cdot \exp(-\Delta\phi^2 / \sigma_c^2).Probabilityofaccessingamemoryortimelineisafunctionofthe * *phasedistance * *(\Delta\phi$) between the observer and the event.
   RC-10  The Coherence Kernel (σ_(c))                $\sigma_c \propto 1 / \sqrt{S_{\rm FRC}}$. The sharpness of the conscious "tape head" is inversely proportional to the system's global coherence.                                                                                      Clarity sharpens Time.
