# Part I: The Physics of a Living Universe — The Logos of Coherence


(The Law is Foundational: Establishing FRC 566)

   Chapter  Original Focus    FRC 566 Synthesis & Core Law
  --------- ---------------- ------------------------------

| 1. The Quantum Riddle | Elegant failure of randomness. | Anchor:
Coherence (C) is the missing variable. |

| 2. The Resonant Collapse | Deterministic phase-locking. |
Thermodynamic Law: Collapse is an exact ΔS ↔ Δln C transaction, not a
jump. (FRC 100.003.566) |

| 10. The Music of the Primes | Riemann Operator and math structure. |
Metaphysical Anchor: The structure of math is an echo of the Coherence
Field. |
