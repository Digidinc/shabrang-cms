---Dossier B.1: The Search for a Seam (Born Rule Deviation)

B.1.1. Core Hypothesis (The Falsifier): A weak, phase-synchronized
resonant driving field, applied during the measurement (collapse) window
of a quantum system prepared in a superposition, will produce a
statistically significant, reversible deviation from the probabilities
predicted by the Born rule. (RC-3)

B.1.2. Experimental Protocol 1: Photon Polarization

- Setup: Use a single-photon source and a Polarizing Beam Splitter (PBS)
  to prepare photons in a 50/50 superposition of horizontal (|H⟩) and
  vertical (|V⟩) polarization.
- Intervention (The Resonant Nudge): Place an electro-optic modulator
  (EOM) just before the PBS. The EOM is triggered to apply a very fast,
  weak electrical pulse during the exact ∼nanosecond window of
  measurement/collapse. This pulse is phase-synced to resonate with one
  polarization state (e.g., |H⟩). The pulse must be weak enough that it
  does not classically rotate the state (verified by pre-measurement
  tomography).
- Procedure:
  - Baseline Run: Record 10⁶ events with the EOM off to establish a
    P = 50.00% baseline.
  - Test Run: Record 5 × 10⁶ events with the EOM pulse applied
    (phase-locked to |H⟩).
  - Reversal Run: Record 5 × 10⁶ events with the EOM pulse phase
    inverted by 180^(∘) (favoring |V⟩).
- Predicted Outcome (FRC Support): The "drive on" events will show a
  statistically significant bias, e.g., P(|H⟩) = 50.05% (a deviation of
  ΔP ≈ 5 × 10⁻⁴). The bias must flip sign in the Reversal Run.
- Falsification Condition: If, after 10⁷ trials, no statistically
  significant, reversible bias above ΔP < 5 × 10⁻⁴ (a five-sigma
  deviation) is detected, the core physical claim of Resonant Collapse
  is falsified.

B.1.3. Experimental Protocol 2: Superconducting Qubits

- Setup: Use a transmon qubit prepared in a |0⟩ + |1⟩ superposition (the
  foundation of quantum computing).
- Intervention: During the highly controllable qubit readout process,
  apply a very weak, precisely shaped microwave pulse phase-synced to
  resonate with the |1⟩ state.
- Advantage: This platform offers high timing precision, allowing for a
  more accurate search for the exact "collapse window" where the
  resonant nudge has maximum effect.
- Falsification Condition: Same as above. The core challenge is the
  precision required to apply the nudge during the rapid,
  femtosecond-scale collapse window.

Dossier B.2: The Harmony of the Elements (Spectral Clustering)

B.2.1. Core Hypothesis: The collected emission spectra of complex
neutral atoms exhibit a non-random harmonic structure of "overtones" not
predicted by the standard model of discrete electron transitions alone.

B.2.2. Data and Method:

- Data Source: The public NIST (National Institute of Standards and
  Technology) Atomic Spectra Database, containing certified line lists
  and relative intensities for complex elements (e.g., Iron, Cobalt).
- Methodology:
  1.  Transform: Convert the discrete list of lines into a continuous
      spectral density function, S(ν).
  2.  Harmonic Analysis (Fourier Transform): Compute the Fourier
      transform, F(f) = |ℱ[S(ν)]|, to identify dominant "beat
      frequencies" (f_(n)).
  3.  Coherence Score (RC-12): Calculate the Harmonic Conformity Score
      H(f₀) to find a fundamental frequency (f₀) whose integer multiples
      (nf₀) yield statistically significant peaks.
- Predicted Outcome (FRC Support): The Fourier spectrum F(f) will not be
  flat noise. It will show sharp, statistically significant peaks at f₀
  and its integer multiples (2f₀, 3f₀, …).
- Falsification Condition: If the Fourier spectra for multiple complex
  elements, after accounting for known instrumental artifacts, show no
  harmonic peaks that significantly exceed a robust statistical null
  model, the claim that atomic structure is governed by universal
  harmonic resonance is falsified.

B.2.3. Critical Controls:

- Differential Analysis (The Iron-Cobalt Test): Perform the analysis on
  two adjacent elements (e.g., Iron and Cobalt). A universal harmonic
  law should persist across both, with the fundamental frequency
  possibly shifting predictably based on nuclear charge/electron count.
- Statistical Null Model: Generate thousands of randomized "fake"
  spectra by slightly jittering the real line positions. Use this large
  sample to build a robust statistical boundary for what "random" looks
  like, proving that the real data's peaks are extreme outliers.
