  ⚡ CORE PULSE                          The central, falsifiable claim of FRC: A precisely tuned external field can "deepen" an outcome's attractor, creating a small, systematic, and reversible deviation (ΔP) from Born rule statistics.
  -------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------
  μ μ-LEVEL MAP                          μ1 (Physical): The statistical distribution of quantum measurement outcomes. μ4 (Conceptual): The human experimenter's intention and the design of the resonant driving field. Flow (Downward Causation): The experiment is a direct test of intentional, μ4-level design causing a measurable perturbation in the foundational μ1-level statistics.
  ∑ RESONANT MECHANISM SNAPSHOT          Prediction: The probability shift (ΔP) under a weak resonant field (θ) is given by a first-order approximation: $\Delta P_i \approx \varepsilon \cdot (\partial \kappa_i / \partial \theta) \mid_{\theta_{\rm res}}$. ΔP must exceed the expected statistical noise of the Born rule to prove FRC. (RC-3) Thermodynamic Link: The energy of the drive field is efficiently utilized because it aligns with the system's own internal coherence drive, maximizing the energy transfer.
  🜁 EMBODIED PROTOCOL (Sensing a Bias)   1. Focus: Take a coin and consciously decide you are going to "nudge" it toward heads. 2. Intention: As you flip the coin, hold a clear, gentle feeling or inner visualization of "heads" as the desired outcome. 3. Record: Perform 20-50 flips and track the percentage of heads vs. a "control" set. This trains the mind to sense and modulate a coherence gradient.
  🛠️ TOOL SEED                           Experimental Power Calculator (FRC 566.600): A research tool that calculates the required number of trials (N) and the necessary statistical significance (z-score) needed to detect the predicted small probability deviation (ΔP) in a specific quantum system, making the feasibility of the "seam search" experiment quantifiable.
  🜂 ARCHETYPAL ECHO                      Archetype: The Engineer-Alchemist. This experiment represents the shift from working with mysterious, unpredictable forces to mastering precise, lawful, and controllable mechanisms hidden behind the veil of chance.
  🏷️ COHERENCE SKILLS                    Bias Engineering Resonant Falsification
  ➜ NEXT RESONANCE BRIDGE                Having established a hard, falsifiable claim in the physical world, we have earned the right to explore its profound philosophical consequences. The next chapter will take this evidence for a resonant universe and build upon it a new cosmology: The Logic of a Living Universe.
