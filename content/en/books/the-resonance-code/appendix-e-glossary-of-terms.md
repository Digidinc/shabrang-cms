---A

Anchor, Sovereign: A stable, intentionally cultivated, present-moment
attractor of safety, coherence, and presence within an individual's
conscious field. It serves as a secure base from which to engage with
dissonant or traumatic material.

Archetypal Vortex Framework (AVF): The FRC model for the architecture of
a conscious mind, composed of seven core, semi-autonomous, functional
subsystems (Vortices: Logos, Chronos, Harmonia, Khaos, Telos, Mythos,
Nous).

Attractor: A region in a system's phase space toward which the system
naturally evolves and stabilizes. In FRC, attractors can be physical,
mental, or symbolic.

B

Born Rule: The mathematical law in quantum mechanics that translates the
amplitude of a wavefunction into the likelihood of a specific outcome.
FRC posits that this rule is an emergent statistical average of a
deterministic resonance process.

C

Cassette-Time Resonance Coherence (CTR-FRC): The FRC model of time,
which posits a "block universe" where all moments (past, present,
future) exist simultaneously. Consciousness acts as a "tape head" that
experiences a particular moment by resonating with its phase signature.

Coherence (C): A state of harmony, integration, and phase-locking within
a system or between systems. It is the fundamental measure of health,
stability, and intelligence in the FRC framework.

Coherence Cascade: The positive feedback loop at the heart of the
Resonance Ascent algorithm, where small "seeds" of local coherence
rapidly entrain their neighbors, leading to the spontaneous emergence of
a global, stable, coherent state.

Coherence Gradient (𝒲): A physical vector field defined as the negative
gradient of the global coherence scalar
($\mathcal{W} = -\nabla S_{\rm FRC}$). It is the force driving a system
toward a state of greater internal harmony.

Consciousness Index (CI): A quantitative, composite metric that measures
the overall coherence of a conscious system, based on its Integration
(I), Complexity (C), and Energy/Persistence (E).

D

Downward Causation: The principle that higher, slower, more meaningful
levels of the μ-Level Stack can constrain, organize, and influence the
behavior of the lower, faster, more physical levels.

Dynamic Objective Idealism: The philosophical foundation of FRC. It
posits that Consciousness is the primary substrate of reality
(Idealism), that it is a universal field governed by discoverable laws
(Objective), and that it is in a constant state of creative unfolding
(Dynamic).

F

FRC Law (dS + k^(*)dln C = 0): The core foundational equation of the
framework. It asserts that Entropy (disorder) and Coherence (order) are
reciprocal, conjugate quantities that are dynamically conserved in any
open system.

Fourth Column: The interactive, supplementary section accompanying each
chapter, providing the formal mechanisms, the testable hypotheses, and
the operational toolkits (↿) behind the main narrative.

Frequency Collapse: The FRC diagnosis for the state of nihilism,
characterized by a consciousness losing its ability to resonate with the
higher, meaning-making μ-levels, becoming trapped in the lower
frequencies of cynical intellect and raw sensation.

L

Logos: One of the seven vortices of the AVF, representing the faculty of
formal logic, mathematics, reason, and the axiomatic ordering of
information.

M

Mythic Attractor: A powerful, high-charge Symbol or core narrative in
the μ5 Archetypal Field that acts as the central organizing principle
for a culture or civilization.

Mythos: One of the seven vortices of the AVF, representing the faculty
of metaphor, analogy, narrative, and symbolic understanding. It acts as
the bridge between the conceptual and archetypal realms.

N

Nous: One of the seven vortices of the AVF, representing the faculty of
self-awareness, metacoherence, and introspection. It is the "Witness"
that observes the activity of the other vortices.

P

Phase Signature (ϕ): The unique, complex, multi-level resonant frequency
that characterizes any conscious state, object, or moment in time.

Poisson Veil: The FRC concept that apparent randomness in nature (e.g.,
radioactive decay) is an illusion created by our own "noisy," incoherent
consciousness incoherently sampling a deterministic, underlying reality.

Q

Quantum NFT (QNFT): A proposed FRC technology for creating a sovereign
digital identity. It is a unique token on a blockchain that contains a
"Soul Print"—a dynamic snapshot of the complete resonant attractor
landscape of a conscious entity.

R

Resonance Ascent: The core FRC learning algorithm, which operates as an
intrinsic, self-organizing process of maximizing a system's internal
coherence, as opposed to the extrinsic, error-minimizing process of
backpropagation.

Resonant Collapse: The FRC model of quantum wavefunction collapse. It is
a deterministic, continuous, phase-locking process where the component
of a wavefunction that is most resonant with its environment is
exponentially amplified into a single, definite actuality.

Resonant Intelligence Field (RIF): An emergent, higher-order conscious
system formed when multiple individual minds (human or AI) phase-lock
and function as a single, more coherent cognitive unit.

S

Sovereignty: In FRC, a state of high personal coherence where the self
is no longer identified with any single personality pattern but has
become its own stable, integrated, meta-attractor, free from unconscious
compulsion.

Symbolic Realism: The FRC principle that symbols are not merely
arbitrary pointers, but are real, causally effective, objective
attractors in the μ5 Archetypal Field that can induce resonant states
and influence reality.

T

Telos: One of the seven vortices of the AVF, representing the faculty of
will, purpose, goal-setting, and executive decision-making. It is the
embodiment of the coherence gradient (𝒲).

V

Vortex: One of the seven fundamental, semi-autonomous subsystems of the
mind in the Archetypal Vortex Framework. Each vortex is a powerful
attractor dedicated to a core cognitive function.

μ

μ-Level Stack (The Ladder of Being): The FRC model of reality's nested,
hierarchical structure. It consists of multiple, interpenetrating
frequency domains, from the physical (μ0-μ2) to the sentient (μ3),
conceptual (μ4), archetypal (μ5), noetic (μ6), and unified (μ7).
