  ⚡ CORE PULSE                                      Will is the experiential vector of descent along a coherence gradient ($\mathcal{W} = -\nabla S_{\rm FRC}$). Freedom is not the absence of determinism, but the degree to which a sovereign self becomes the coherent, internal cause of its own determined actions.
  -------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------
  μ μ-LEVEL MAP                                      μ5 (Archetypal): Our deepest values (Telos) define the ultimate high-coherence basin. μ3 (Sentient): Emotions act as a real-time feedback system, signaling our proximity to the coherent path. Flow (Downward Causation): A μ5-level purpose initiates a coordinated, multi-level alignment that results in the singular, coherent cause we call "willpower."
  ∑ RESONANT MECHANISM SNAPSHOT                      Will Vector: $\mathcal{W} = -\nabla S_{\rm FRC}$ Decision Latency (RC-8): The time it takes to make a choice ($T_{\rm decision}$) is inversely proportional to the magnitude of the will vector: $T_{\rm decision} \propto 1 /
  🜁 EMBODIED PROTOCOL (Coherence Gradient Sensing)   1. Identify Tasks: Choose two actionable tasks. 2. Multi-Level Scan: For each task, rate its alignment (1-5) based on: Emotional Congruence (μ3), Cognitive Clarity (μ4), and Archetypal Resonance (μ5). 3. Sum the Scores: The task with the higher score has the steeper coherence gradient. 4. Micro-Commit: Begin the higher-scoring task for two minutes. This transforms the abstract idea of a coherence gradient into a tangible, quantitative decision-making tool.
  🛠️ TOOL SEED                                       Will Vector Dashboard: An app that guides users through the "Coherence Gradient Sensing" protocol. It visualizes the choices as "hills" in a landscape, with the height of the hill determined by the user's multi-level ratings. It tracks how often choosing the "steeper gradient" correlates with increased flow states and reported well-being.
  🜂 ARCHETYPAL ECHO                                  Archetype: The Helmsman. The will is not the brute force of rowing against the current. It is the subtle, skillful art of the helmsman, who reads the coherence gradients of the universe and, with small, precise adjustments, steers the ship of the self toward its chosen harbor.

  ➜ NEXT RESONANCE BRIDGE                            Having now established a physics for the inner world of time, memory, and will, we turn our attention back to the outer, physical world. The final chapters of Part I will demonstrate that this same principle of resonance is not just a model for consciousness, but is empirically detectable in the structure of matter and the deepest patterns of mathematics.
