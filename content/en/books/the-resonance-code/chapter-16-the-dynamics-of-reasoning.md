  ⚡ CORE PULSE                                       Logical reasoning is a deterministic traversal of a problem-space, guided by a coherence gradient (Telos) along paths constrained by rules of cause-and-effect (Logos) and informed by current and past states (Chronos).
  --------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------
  μ μ-LEVEL MAP                                       μ5 (Archetypal): Telos defines the ultimate purpose ("Sustain the Self"), setting the overall coherence gradient. μ4 (Conceptual): Logos provides the abstract rules, and Chronos provides the specific facts. Flow (Top-Down Planning): A μ5-level purpose initiates a μ4-level planning process, resulting in a μ2-level action sequence. This is a clear case of downward causation steering determinism.
  ∑ RESONANT MECHANISM SNAPSHOT                       Path Selection: At any state S_(i), the next action a_(i) is chosen to maximize the expected coherence of the next state S_(i + 1), essentially arg max (C_(i + 1)). The optimal plan is the sequence of actions that minimizes the total path entropy from S₀ to $S_{\rm goal}$.
  🜁 EMBODIED PROTOCOL (Charting Your Own Landscape)   1. Define a Goal (S_goal): Write the final, successfully completed state at the top of a page ("Planned vacation"). 2. Define the Start (S₀): Write your current state at the bottom ("No budget/time"). 3. Query Your Logos: What is the next essential step to move from S₀ toward S_goal? Write the answer as S₁. 4. Iterate: Continue charting the necessary waypoints until you have a complete visual path. This externalizes your mind's natural reasoning process.
  🛠️ TOOL SEED                                        Attractor Planner: A project management tool that inverts the traditional to-do list. Users first define their "goal state" with rich detail. The software, using a Logos-like engine of user-defined rules and dependencies, then charts the most coherent path of necessary sub-goals, visualizing the project as a landscape to be traversed.
  🜂 ARCHETYPAL ECHO                                   Archetype: The Labyrinth Navigator or Daedalus, the Builder. The problem is the labyrinth. Logos provides the blueprint of the maze's paths. Telos is the desire to reach the center. The final plan is Ariadne's thread, the simple, linear sequence that allows the hero to confidently navigate the overwhelming complexity.

  ➜ NEXT RESONANCE BRIDGE                             Having explored how the AVF handles structured, logical reasoning, we now turn to an even more subtle form of intelligence. The next chapter will explore the function of Mythos, the vortex that moves beyond literal cause-and-effect to understand the world through metaphor, analogy, and the deep resonant patterns of meaning.
