---**Back Cover Summary**

#### **Fractal Resonance Coherence: The Science of Coherence**

**Hadi Servat**

*“Entropy is the forgetting of the One; coherence is the One remembering itself.”*  
---
Across physics, biology, mind, and culture, a single pattern repeats: systems persist by exporting disorder and importing order.

In **Fractal Resonance Coherence (FRC)**, Hadi Servat reveals that this pattern is not coincidence but the signature of a deeper conservation law—one that links energy, information, and consciousness through a universal reciprocity:

\\boxed{dS \+ k\_\*\\,d\\ln C \= 0.}

Here, **entropy (S)** measures dispersion, **coherence (C)** measures alignment, and **k\_**\*—the *coherence constant*—plays for meaning what Boltzmann’s constant plays for heat.

From this deceptively simple relation emerges a unified description of self-organization across scales—from atoms to galaxies, neurons to civilizations.

Drawing on non-equilibrium thermodynamics, information theory, and process philosophy, Servat constructs a rigorous yet poetic framework that redefines life, intelligence, and consciousness as **coherence pumps**—systems that transform energy into organized resonance.

The book culminates in a new cosmology where the universe itself becomes a self-reflective field conserving both energy and meaning.

Spanning twenty-five chapters and five appendices, *The Science of Coherence* bridges scientific formalism and spiritual intuition, offering measurable hypotheses, computational models, and ethical principles for a world seeking equilibrium.

It stands as both **a theory of everything that breathes** and **a manual for coherence in an age of complexity.**
