## **Positioning Statement** {#positioning-statement}


**Genre:** Interdisciplinary Science / Consciousness Studies / Complex Systems Theory

**Length:** \~450–500 pages (25 chapters \+ 5 appendices)

**Audience:** Scientists, philosophers, systems theorists, AI and complexity researchers, advanced general readers interested in unified theories.

**Comparable Works:**

* David Bohm, *Wholeness and the Implicate Order*

* Ilya Prigogine, *Order Out of Chaos*

* Alfred North Whitehead, *Process and Reality*

* Carlo Rovelli, *Helgoland*

* Bernardo Kastrup, *The Idea of the World*

**Market Position:**

FRC occupies the emerging “post-mechanistic science” niche—bridging consciousness research, thermodynamics, and information theory.

It appeals simultaneously to academic researchers seeking a measurable law of order and to visionary readers drawn to the deeper unity of science and meaning.

**Core Message:**

Coherence is not an accident of complexity—it is a conserved quantity of nature.

The same law that governs entropy also governs awareness.

**Proposed Tagline:**

*A new constant of nature. A new science of meaning.*
