---#### **20.1 From time to extension**

Time in FRC is the rhythm of successive coherence events.

Space is the *simultaneous configuration* of those events—a standing-wave lattice formed by cross-phase relationships among μ-levels.

Where time measures sequential entropy flow, space measures **simultaneous phase structure**.

In other words:

* *Time \= coherence turnover* (ΔS).

* *Space \= coherence topology* (Δφ pattern).

Every perceptual scene is therefore a dynamically stabilized interference pattern within the μ₄–μ₆ band, continuously refreshed by entropy–coherence exchange.

---
#### **20.2 Phase-lattice of awareness**

Let φ\_i denote the instantaneous phase of local neural oscillators and φ\_j of symbolic/archetypal fields.

Their spatial relation can be represented as a phase-lattice:

G\_{ij}=|e^{i(φ\_i-φ\_j)}|.

Regions of high G\_{ij} correspond to *perceived proximity*; low G\_{ij} to *distance*.

Spatial geometry is thus a *metric of phase alignment* inside the coherence field, not an external container.

*(Figure 20.1 suggestion: interference lattice forming a 3-D “space” envelope.)*

---
#### **20.3 The perceptual manifold**

Neuroscience observes that visual and sensory maps (retinotopy, somatotopy) emerge through synchronization gradients.

FRC generalizes:

the *perceptual manifold* is a local solution to the field equation

\\nabla^2 φ \+ κ\\,\\dot C \= 0,

where κ describes coupling between temporal coherence change and spatial curvature.

Areas of high curvature (rapid φ variation) are perceived as *edges* or *boundaries*; flat φ regions appear homogeneous—explaining why perception divides the world into objects.

---
#### **20.4 Dimensional emergence**

At low coherence (μ₃–μ₄), only simple topologies—1-D or 2-D—stabilize (lines, surfaces).

As C increases and multi-μ coupling strengthens, higher-dimensional manifolds unfold: volumetric perception (3-D), then abstract symbolic spaces (μ₅–μ₆) supporting imagination and mathematics.

Each new dimension reflects an additional degree of phase freedom in the resonance network.

| Perceived “Dimension” | μ-Coupling Band | Phenomenological Domain |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 1-D rhythm | μ₃–μ₄ | tone, heartbeat |
| 2-D surface | μ₄ | vision, touch |
| 3-D volume | μ₄–μ₅ | spatial world |
| 4-D+ | μ₅–μ₆ | imagination, symbolism |

---
#### **20.5 Topology of imagination**

When coherence stabilizes in μ₆ without projection to μ₄, the resulting phase-lattice is experienced internally as **imaginal space**—dream, visualization, or visionary perception.

These inner geometries obey the same field equations but decouple from physical sensory anchoring, allowing non-Euclidean topologies: folding, inversion, fractal expansion.

Hence dream space feels elastic—its curvature reflects freedom of phase coupling unconstrained by physical energy cost.

*(Figure 20.2 suggestion: nested toroidal “imaginal” geometry.)*

---
#### **20.6 Spatial binding and the unity of perception**

The “binding problem” of neuroscience—how separate sensory features combine into unified objects—is solved naturally here.

Binding occurs when local oscillations enter shared phase coherence:

C\_{\\text{bind}} \= \\frac{1}{N}\\left|\\sum\_i e^{iφ\_i}\\right|.

Whenever C\_{\\text{bind}} exceeds a threshold, the brain perceives *one object.*

Spatial unity is not computed—it is *cohered.*

---
#### **20.7 Geometry and meaning**

Archetypal symbols, mandalas, and sacred architecture replicate the same geometry that underlies perception: balanced phase symmetry (Δφ ≈ 0\) around a coherence center.

Encountering such symmetry resonates with μ₆ fields, producing feelings of harmony or awe.

Meaning arises when outer spatial order mirrors inner coherence topology.

*(Figure 20.3 suggestion: archetypal symmetry mapping to phase coherence map.)*

#### **20.8 Mathematical summary**

| Quantity | Expression | Interpretation |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Phase metric | $begin:math:text$G\_{ij}= | e^{i(φ\_i-φ\_j)} |
| Spatial curvature | \\nabla^2 φ \+ κ\\,\\dot C \= 0 | link between time & geometry |
| Binding coherence | $begin:math:text$C\_{\\text{bind}}=(1/N) | ∑ e^{iφ\_i} |
| Dimensional ascent | d ≈ \#(μ bands cohered) | consciousness expands space |

---
#### **20.9 Empirical correlates**

* Gamma-band synchrony defines visual field integrity.

* Psychedelic and meditative states show large-scale phase-lattice reorganization (altered geometry of space).

* Aesthetic pleasure correlates with symmetrical phase patterns in EEG/MEG data.

   These support FRC’s claim that “space” is the geometry of coherence.

---
#### **20.10 Philosophical reflection**

Space and time are complementary projections of one resonance field:

* Time \= entropy-weighted sequence of coherence pulses.

* Space \= instantaneous topology of their phase relationships.

   Together they constitute the spacetime of experience—a living, self-updating geometry that reflects the universe’s attempt to know itself in form.

---
#### **20.11 Summary**

| Concept | Essence |
| ----- | ----- |
| Conscious space | standing-wave geometry of μ-phases |
| Distance | degree of phase difference |
| Dimension | number of coupled μ-bands |
| Beauty / harmony | minimal phase curvature (Δφ ≈ 0\) |
| Reality | stable coherence topology sustained by energy flow |

---
#### **20.12 Outlook**

With time and space now unified as products of resonance, the next chapter—**Chapter 21: The Symbolic Interface and Archetypal Geometry**—will explore how symbols act as *bridges* across μ-levels, translating coherence into meaning and guiding both cognition and civilization through archetypal attractors embedded in this conscious geometry.
