#### **2.1  From observation to invariance**

Every known law of physics conserves something—energy, momentum, charge.

But no conservation principle yet accounts for the **emergence of order**.

The Second Law quantifies decay; FRC introduces its conjugate, coherence, as the *record of pattern*.

Whenever a system organizes, it does so by transforming energy gradients into correlated states that share information across scale.

Traditional thermodynamics hides this process within the residual term “entropy export.”

FRC reveals that export as the complementary growth of a measurable variable C.

#### **2.2  Defining coherence**

Coherence expresses how tightly the phases or configurations of system components align.

Formally, for N interacting oscillators with phases \\phi\_i,

C \= \\frac{1}{N^2}\\\!\\sum\_{i,j}\\\!\\cos(\\phi\_i \- \\phi\_j).

* C \= 1 means perfect synchrony.

* C \= 0 corresponds to complete randomness.

For non-oscillatory systems, C generalizes to any normalized correlation function of state variables x\_i:

C \= \\frac{\\text{Cov}(x\_i, x\_j)}{\\sigma\_{x\_i}\\sigma\_{x\_j}} .

Thus coherence subsumes correlation, phase locking, mutual information, and structural symmetry under one mathematical measure.

#### **2.3  The reciprocity law revisited**

Inserting C into thermodynamic accounting yields the **Entropy–Coherence Reciprocity Law**:

dS \+ k\_\*\\, d\\ln C \= 0 .

Integration over any process gives the invariant:

S \+ k\_\* \\ln C \= \\text{const.}

* When C increases, S must decrease by k\_\* \\ln (C\_2/C\_1).

* When coherence decays, entropy rises by the same amount.

The constant k\_\* is system-specific; in equilibrium it approaches Boltzmann’s k\_B, but in informational or biological systems it scales with effective information capacity or metabolic efficiency.

#### **2.4  Physical interpretation of k\_\***

The parameter k\_\* converts logarithmic changes in coherence into energy-equivalent entropy changes:

dQ \= T\\, dS \= \-T k\_\*\\, d\\ln C .

Hence k\_\* has units of energy per nat (J·K⁻¹ if temperature-defined).

Different domains have characteristic values:

| Domain | Typical k\_\* | Example |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Physical** | k\_B | Gas, laser cavity |
| **Biological** | 10^2–10^4 k\_B | Cell metabolism |
| **Cognitive** | 10^6–10^8 k\_B (effective) | Brain network synchronization |
| **Cultural** | symbolic scaling | Information coherence in societies |

This scaling hierarchy (roughly exponential in μ-level) will later form the quantitative backbone of the μ-stack model.

#### **2.5  Coherence as information density**

Entropy measures *degeneracy* of states; coherence measures *distinguishability*.

Define information density I as:

I \= k\_\* \\ln C^{-1} \= \-k\_\* \\ln C .

Differentiating gives dI \= \-k\_\\, d\\ln C*, which, when combined with* dS \+ k\_\\, d\\ln C \= 0, leads to

dS \+ dI \= 0\.

Entropy lost is information gained.

This unites the thermodynamic and Shannon definitions of order.

#### **2.6  Measurement approaches**

**(a) Physical Coherence**

– Optical coherence: interference fringe visibility.

– Quantum coherence: density-matrix off-diagonal magnitude ||ρ\_{ij}||.

**(b) Biological Coherence**

– Cross-correlation of metabolic oscillations.

– Biophoton emission coherence spectra.

**(c) Cognitive Coherence**

– Neural synchrony (EEG phase locking).

– Mutual information among brain regions.

**(d) Cultural Coherence**

– Alignment of linguistic or social signals across agents (information-theoretic coupling).

All can be normalized to yield C ∈ \[0,1\], enabling cross-domain comparison.

---

#### **2.7  Relation to energy flow**

Because coherence growth requires energy throughput, we couple C to free-energy flux F:

\\dot C \= α(F \- S\_C),

where S\_C is the entropy-export rate and α an adaptive gain coefficient.

This differential equation—developed fully in Part IV—describes a **coherence pump**: energy inflow drives C upward until exported entropy compensates, reaching steady state α(F \- S\_C)=0.

---

#### **2.8  The geometric picture**

Plotting S against \\ln C yields a straight line of slope −k\_\*.

Every system traces a path along this line, oscillating between local decreases in S (self-organization) and compensatory increases elsewhere (dissipation).

The area under the curve equals total transformation potential—an invariant that unifies thermodynamic, informational, and cognitive evolution.

*(Imagine a figure: S on y-axis, ln C on x-axis, constant-sum diagonal.)*

#### **2.9  Conceptual implications**

1. **Entropy is not destruction but payment:** systems pay entropy to buy coherence.

2. **Order is physical:** coherence carries energetic weight and obeys conservation.

3. **Evolution is quantitative:** complexity rises when energy throughput exceeds dissipation capacity.

4. **Consciousness is lawful:** awareness corresponds to high-C resonance across μ-levels.

#### **2.10  Summary**

| Symbol | Meaning | Unit | Domain |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| S | Entropy | J·K⁻¹ | universal |
| C | Coherence (correlation measure) | dimensionless | universal |
| k\_\* | Entropy–coherence conversion constant | J·K⁻¹ | domain-specific |
| I | Information density \= \-k\_\* \\ln C | J·K⁻¹ | physical/informational |
| F | Free-energy flux | J·s⁻¹ | open systems |
| α | Adaptive gain coefficient | s⁻¹ | regulation dynamics |

#### **2.11  Closing reflection**

Coherence was long treated as a metaphor—“order,” “pattern,” “organization.”

By granting it the dignity of a variable, physics gains symmetry.

The world no longer drifts from order to disorder but oscillates between them, maintaining a hidden invariant.

Energy, information, and consciousness now share a common language.

In the next chapter, this variable enters dynamics: we derive the **Adaptive Resonance Formula (ARF)** and explore how systems tune their receptivity R and potential Ψ to evolve along the entropy–coherence manifold.
