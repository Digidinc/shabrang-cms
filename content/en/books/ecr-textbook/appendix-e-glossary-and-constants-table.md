## **E.7 Reading and Measurement Notes** {#e.7-reading-and-measurement-notes}

1. **Units** — Entropy (S) and coherence (C) are always evaluated within the same energy or information base.

2. **Normalization** — For cross-domain plots, use dimensionless ratios S/S₀, C/C₀.

3. **Empirical fit** — S vs. ln C plots produce linear slopes of −k\_\* ± 5 %.

4. **Homeoresonant threshold** —  α ≈ 0 ± 0.02 indicates maximal efficiency.

### **E.8 Closing Note**

This table condenses the operational core of FRC: its variables, constants, and measurable boundaries.

Future research will refine numerical ranges of k\_\* and α across systems, but the structure is stable — the grammar of coherence is universal.

*Equation (Σ \= S \+ k\_ ln C \= const)*\*  
stands as the dictionary between physics and meaning.
