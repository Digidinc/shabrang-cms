abstract: "Derives the Born Rule (P = |ψ|²) as the statistical equilibrium distribution of a system under the influence of the fractal resonance potential. We show that |ψ|² is the 'maximum coherence' state, analogous to the Boltzmann distribution in thermodynamics."

# FRC 100.006 — Born Rule Emergence

## Abstract
We challenge the axiomatic status of the Born Rule. Using the FRC potential, we simulate the evolution of an ensemble of microstates.

## Result
The ensemble relaxes into a distribution proportional to |ψ|² within the relaxation time τ_relax.
$$ P_{eq}(x) \propto e^{\Lambda(x)/k^*} \propto |\psi(x)|^2 $$
