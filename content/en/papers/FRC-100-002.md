abstract: "Applies the FRC framework to the quantum stadium billiard. We demonstrate that introducing a fractal resonance potential modulates the nodal patterns of the wavefunction, increasing their fractal dimension from D≈1.2 to D≈1.90, suggesting a deterministic substructure to quantum chaos."

# FRC 100.002 — Nodal Patterns in Stadium Billiard

## Abstract
Standard quantum chaos theory predicts random nodal patterns (Berry's conjecture). This paper introduces a deterministic perturbation based on the FRC potential $V_{FRC}$.

## Key Findings
1. **Fractal Dimension Shift:** Under FRC perturbation ($\sigma=0.1$), the nodal patterns exhibit self-similarity with $D \approx 1.90$.
2. **Scarring:** Enhanced scarring along periodic orbits is observed, but with fractal fine structure.
3. **Implications:** This suggests that 'random' quantum chaotic states may actually be phase-locked to a fractal attractor.
