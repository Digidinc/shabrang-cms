# FRC 100.010 — Foundational Questions

## Q: Does FRC violate Bell's Inequalities?
**A:** No. FRC is a non-local realist theory. The Lambda field acts globally, providing the necessary correlations without requiring superluminal signaling of information (only phase).

## Q: Is the Lambda field detectable?
**A:** Yes, via the predicted Born rule deviations in resonant cavities (see FRC-100-007).
