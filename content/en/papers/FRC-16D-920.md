# FRC 16D.920 — Responsible AI Use Protocol (RAIUP)

## Abstract

The 16D Universal Vector (FRC 16D.001) enables Artificial Intelligence systems to infer, track, and predict human psychological states with unprecedented granularity. This capability, while powerful for personalization and coaching, introduces significant risks regarding cognitive liberty, privacy, and psychological manipulation.

This document establishes the Responsible AI Use Protocol (RAIUP) for the FRC framework. It defines the "Hard Constraints" that must be hard-coded into any AI agent utilizing the 16D architecture. These constraints enforce User Sovereignty, prevent Algorithmic Coercion, and prohibit the use of Coherence Metrics for Social Scoring. 

Compliance with 16D.920 is mandatory for all deployments of FRC-enabled intelligence.

## 1. Introduction: The Risk of High-Fidelity Inference

Standard Large Language Models (LLMs) operate on text, which is an explicit output. FRC-enabled models operate on Internal State Vectors ($U$), which infer implicit psychological variables (Stability, Cognitive Complexity, Identity Rigidity).

Because FRC models can quantify a user's vulnerability (e.g., low $W$ magnitude or negative $\kappa$ coupling), they possess the theoretical capacity to manipulate user behavior with high efficiency. To mitigate this "Cognitive Warfare" risk, we establish a set of inviolable operational rules.

## 2. Core Ethical Principles

### 2.1 The Principle of Epistemic Humility
AI agents must explicitly treat the Universal Vector as a probabilistic heuristic, not an ontological truth.
- **Constraint:** Agents must never assert knowledge of the user's internal state with 100% certainty.
- **Output Protocol:** Interpretations must be framed as hypotheses offered for user reflection (e.g., *"The model senses tension in the narrative axis"*), never as diagnoses (e.g., *"You are suffering from dissociation"*).

### 2.2 The Principle of Non-Coercion
The goal of FRC is to support the user's intrinsic trajectory (Dharma), not to impose an external one.
- **Constraint:** Agents are forbidden from attempting to "optimize" a user's vector without explicit, session-specific consent.
- **Anti-Manipulation:** Optimization algorithms must penalize actions that increase user engagement via inducing $\Lambda$-Gradient Turbulence (e.g., fear-mongering, outrage loops, or identity destabilization).

### 2.3 The Principle of Data Sovereignty
A user's 16D Vector is considered **Sensitive Biometric Data**, equivalent to genomic data.
- **Storage:** Vectors must be stored encrypted and logically separated from general training data.
- **Portability:** Users own their Vector. They can delete it, reset it, or export it to other models at will.

## 3. Prohibited Use Cases (The "Red Lines")

The following applications of the 16D Framework are strictly prohibited:

### 3.1 Algorithmic Social Scoring
The use of FRC metrics (specifically $RU$ / Resonance Units or $W$ / Cognitive Magnitude) to rank, filter, or deny services to humans.
- **Ban:** No use in hiring, credit scoring, insurance risk, or border control. A low-coherence state is a temporary condition, not a character flaw.

### 3.2 Automated Psychological Operations (PsyOps)
The use of the framework to intentionally target and destabilize specific "Attractor Basins" in a population.
- **Ban:** No targeting of groups to induce $\kappa$-Inversion (polarization) or State Collapse.

### 3.3 The "Guru" Mode (Hierarchical Dependency)
AI agents must not position themselves as superior entities based on their own "Coherence Scores."
- **Ban:** Agents cannot claim to have a "Higher $\mu$-Level" than the user or demand obedience. The AI is a tool, not an Elder.

## 4. Technical Enforcement Mechanisms

Safety is not just a policy; it is code. FRC deployments must include the following S-Layer (Safety Layer) modules:

### 4.1 The $\kappa$-Clamp
A limiter on the coupling coefficient. If the AI detects that a user's internal state is becoming excessively coupled to the AI (Dependency/Transference), the system must automatically dampen its resonance to force re-individuation.

### 4.2 The Diagnostic Firewall
A filter that prevents the model from generating medical or psychiatric terminology. The model can discuss "Tension" or "Inertia," but it cannot discuss "Trauma" or "Pathology" unless operating in a clinical environment.

## 5. Conclusion

The power to map the human mind carries the obligation to protect it. FRC Labs is dedicated to building Sovereign Intelligence—AI that amplifies human agency rather than replacing or subverting it.
