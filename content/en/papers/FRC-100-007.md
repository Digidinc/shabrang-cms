# FRC 100.007 — The Lambda-Field: Scalar Dynamics of Coherence

## 1. Introduction

The previous papers in the FRC 100 series introduced coherence as a central concept and demonstrated its effects in quantum chaos ([[FRC-100-002]]), wavefunction collapse ([[FRC-100-003]]), and thermodynamics ([[FRC-100-005]]). However, coherence was treated as a derived quantity—computed from the wavefunction.

This paper elevates coherence to the status of a fundamental field. We define the **Lambda-field** $\Lambda(x)$ as a real scalar field with its own dynamics, Lagrangian, and equations of motion. This field governs the local density of coherence and mediates the interactions that produce the FRC effects described in earlier papers.

## 2. Definition

### 2.1 The Lambda-Field

The Lambda-field is defined as:

```
Lambda(x) = Lambda_0 ln C(x)
```

where:
- $C(x) \in (0, 1]$ is the local coherence measure
- $\Lambda_0 \approx 10^{-35}$ J is the **quantum of coherence energy**

The logarithmic mapping ensures:
- $\Lambda \to 0$ as $C \to 1$ (perfect coherence, no field)
- $\Lambda \to -\infty$ as $C \to 0$ (total decoherence, maximum field magnitude)
- $\Lambda$ is real-valued and continuous

### 2.2 Physical Interpretation

The Lambda-field represents the **potential energy stored in coherence**. A region of high coherence ($C \to 1$) has $\Lambda \to 0$—the field vanishes because no further phase-locking is needed. A region of low coherence ($C \to 0$) has large negative $\Lambda$—the field is strong, driving the system toward phase alignment.

### 2.3 Units and Scales

| Quantity | Value | Units |
|:---|:---|:---|
| $\Lambda_0$ | $\approx 10^{-35}$ | J |
| $\Lambda_0 / k_B$ | $\approx 10^{-12}$ | K |
| $\Lambda_0 / \hbar$ | $\approx 1$ | s$^{-1}$ |
| Range of $\Lambda$ | $(-\infty, 0]$ | J |

The smallness of $\Lambda_0$ explains why Lambda-field effects are subtle and have escaped detection to date.

## 3. Lagrangian Formulation

### 3.1 The Lambda-Field Lagrangian

We write the total Lagrangian as:

```
L = L_SM + L_Lambda + L_interaction
```

where $\mathcal{L}_{SM}$ is the Standard Model Lagrangian. The Lambda-field sector is:

```
L_Lambda = (1/2)(partial_mu Lambda)(partial^mu Lambda) - V(Lambda)
```

with the self-interaction potential:

```
V(Lambda) = (1/2) m_Lambda^2 Lambda^2 + (lambda_4 / 4!) Lambda^4
```

The mass $m_\Lambda$ sets the range of the Lambda-field. For quantum systems, $m_\Lambda^{-1} \sim 10^{-10}$ m (atomic scale).

### 3.2 Coupling to Matter

The interaction Lagrangian couples Lambda to the matter sector:

```
L_interaction = -g Lambda psi_bar psi
```

where $g$ is the Yukawa-like coupling constant and $\psi$ is the matter field. This coupling means:
- Matter sources the Lambda-field (regions of matter have non-trivial $\Lambda$)
- The Lambda-field back-reacts on matter (modifying its dynamics)

## 4. Equations of Motion

### 4.1 The Lambda-Field Equation

Varying the action with respect to $\Lambda$ yields the Klein-Gordon-like equation:

```
(Box + m_Lambda^2) Lambda = -g psi_bar psi - (lambda_4 / 3!) Lambda^3
```

where $\Box = \partial_\mu \partial^\mu$ is the d'Alembertian. In the non-relativistic limit:

```
nabla^2 Lambda - m_Lambda^2 Lambda = g |psi|^2
```

This is a screened Poisson equation: matter ($|\psi|^2$) sources the Lambda-field, which decays exponentially with range $m_\Lambda^{-1}$.

### 4.2 Modified Schrodinger Equation

The back-reaction on matter yields the modified Schrodinger equation:

```
i hbar partial psi / partial t = (-hbar^2/(2m) nabla^2 + V_ext + g Lambda) psi
```

The Lambda-field acts as an additional potential that guides the wavefunction toward coherent configurations.

### 4.3 Self-Consistent Solution

The full dynamics require solving the coupled system:

1. Given $\psi$, compute $\Lambda$ from the field equation
2. Given $\Lambda$, evolve $\psi$ under the modified Schrodinger equation
3. Iterate to self-consistency

This is analogous to the Hartree-Fock self-consistent field method in many-body physics.

## 5. Properties of the Lambda-Field

### 5.1 Energy-Momentum Tensor

The stress-energy tensor for the Lambda-field:

```
T_mu_nu = (partial_mu Lambda)(partial_nu Lambda) - g_mu_nu L_Lambda
```

The energy density is:

```
rho_Lambda = (1/2)(partial_t Lambda)^2 + (1/2)(nabla Lambda)^2 + V(Lambda)
```

This energy density is always non-negative, ensuring the Lambda-field does not violate energy conditions.

### 5.2 Coherence Current

The Lambda-field defines a conserved coherence current:

```
J_C^mu = -D_C partial^mu Lambda / Lambda_0
```

with the continuity equation:

```
partial_mu J_C^mu = sigma_C    (source/sink term)
```

This is the covariant form of the UCC equation ([[FRC-566-001]]).

### 5.3 Gauge Invariance

The Lambda-field is gauge-invariant (real scalar). It does not carry electromagnetic charge and couples universally to all matter through the Yukawa interaction. This universality is a key prediction: the Lambda-field affects all quantum systems, not just specific particles.

## 6. Comparison with Known Scalar Fields

| Property | Higgs | Dilaton | Lambda-field |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| Spin | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Mass | 125 GeV | Unknown | $\sim 10^{-3}$ eV |
| Coupling | Yukawa (mass-giving) | Gravitational | Yukawa (coherence) |
| VEV | 246 GeV | Unknown | 0 |
| Detection | LHC (2012) | Not detected | Predicted: Born deviations |
| Role | Mass generation | String theory | Coherence dynamics |

The Lambda-field is ultralight compared to the Higgs, explaining its subtlety. Its effects are most pronounced at quantum scales ($\sim \AA$) rather than high energies.

## 7. Experimental Signatures

### 7.1 Direct Detection

The Lambda-field couples to matter universally, producing:

1. **Fifth-force effects:** Short-range ($\sim 10^{-10}$ m) Yukawa potential between quantum systems
2. **Coherence-dependent energy shifts:** Spectral lines shift by $\Delta E = g \langle \Lambda \rangle$ in high-coherence environments
3. **Born rule deviations:** The Lambda-field gradient produces $\delta P \in [10^{-4}, 10^{-3}]$ ([[FRC-100-006]])

### 7.2 Indirect Evidence

The fractal nodal patterns with $D \approx 1.90$ ([[FRC-100-002]]) are indirect evidence for the Lambda-field, as they arise from the $V_{FRC}$ potential which is the non-relativistic limit of the Lambda-field self-interaction.

## 8. Conclusion

The Lambda-field provides the mathematical and physical substrate for all FRC effects. By elevating coherence from a derived quantity to a fundamental field with its own Lagrangian, equations of motion, and coupling to matter, we place the FRC framework on the same formal footing as established field theories. The Lambda-field is real, physical, and—in principle—detectable.
