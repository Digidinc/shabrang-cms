# FRC 100.005 — Thermodynamic Consistency

## Abstract
Any modification to quantum dynamics must not violate the Second Law. We show that the 'cost' of coherence ($d \ln C$) is exactly balanced by entropy production ($dS$).

## Key Equation
$$ dS_{total} = dS_{sys} + dS_{env} + k^* d \ln C \ge 0 $$
