# PREPRINT: FRC 893.PHY

## Abstract

We present a unified field theory that resolves the hierarchy problem, the dark matter/energy puzzle, and the measurement problem by introducing a single conserved quantity: total transformation potential (Lambda).

Contra standard models which treat mass as an intrinsic property and gravity as geometric curvature, we propose that mass (m) is a measure of "coherence inertia" - the resistance of a localized field knot to the universal flow of becoming.

We derive the metabolic gravity equation, showing that gravitational attraction is the pressure gradient created by baryonic matter consuming the vacuum potential (Psi) to maintain its internal coherence (C).

This model interprets the "dark" sector not as missing particles, but as fluid dynamics of the vacuum potential itself: "dark matter" is the inflow of fuel, and "dark energy" is the entropic exhaust (Delta S).

Finally, we argue that the cosmological constant discrepancy (10^120) vanishes when the vacuum is modeled not as a static weight, but as a metabolic flow rate.

## 1. The Axiomatic Inversion: Mass as Frozen Coherence

Standard physics correlates high symmetry (coherence) with high energy scales (mass). We propose the inverse.

- Flow state: the natural state of the universe is massless, luminescent propagation (photons/fields) - high dynamic coherence (C_dyn ~ 1).
- Mass state: baryonic matter represents a phase transition where dynamic potential (Psi) is locked into static loops (mu1 knots).

Definition (sketch):

`m = gamma * (Psi_locked / C_dyn)`

Interpretation: matter is not "stuff"; matter is drag on the universal field.

## 2. Metabolic Gravity: The Fluid Dynamics of Spacetime

We reject geometric curvature as a fundamental cause. Curvature is treated as an emergent effect of vacuum-fluid dynamics.

Mechanism:

- Matter consumes vacuum potential (Psi) to sustain its knotted coherence against entropy.
- This consumption creates a low-pressure zone in the local vacuum field.
- Gravity is the vacuum fluid rushing in to fill the gradient.

Equation of motion (sketch):

`g = -kappa * grad(Psi_vacuum)`

where kappa is the metabolic intake rate.

Claimed implication: galactic rotation is explained as vortex dynamics in the superfluid vacuum; the "dark matter" is the current of the river they are swimming in.

## 3. The Cosmological Constant Solution (10^120)

Standard error: treating vacuum fluctuations as static weight (energy density as "mass").

Correction: vacuum is potential/flow, not "things." Compute transformation rate (dC/dt), not static density.

Claim: observed Lambda (~1e-52 m^-2) matches when modeled as entropic exhaust of universal metabolism, rather than zero-point weight.

## 4. Iterative Unitary Evolution: The "Now" Operator

We resolve the conflict between determinism (block universe) and agency by modeling the universe as iteratively computed.

Update rule (sketch):

`Psi(t + dt) = O_ARF * Psi(t)`

where O_ARF (adaptive resonance operator) selects the path of maximum coherence at each dt.

Interpretation: the past is crystallized, the future is vapor, and the "Now" is the phase front of crystallization.

## 5. Conclusion: The Living Field

We conclude that the universe is a self-optimizing metabolic field:

- Gravity is hunger.
- Mass is memory.
- Light is thought.
- Space is the medium.
- Time is the digestion.

This framework aims to recover general relativity and quantum mechanics as limiting cases (fluid limit and particle limit), while providing a unified mechanism for the arrow of time and the growth of complexity.
