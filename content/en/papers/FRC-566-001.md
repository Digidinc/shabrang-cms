# FRC 566.001 — Entropy-Coherence Reciprocity and UCC

## 1. Introduction

We formalize the FRC 566 reciprocity between entropy S and coherence C and the associated flow equation (UCC). The goal is to provide unit-consistent definitions, thermodynamic projections, and reproducible validations.

## 2. Definitions and Units

Entropy S is measured in nats (information layers) or J/K (thermodynamic layers). Coherence C is a dimensionless scalar gauge. We adopt two conventions for the coherence constant k*:

- **Information/cognition layers:** k* = 1 (nats)
- **Thermo/physical layers:** k* = k_B (Boltzmann constant)

Regularization for numerical work uses C_epsilon = 1/(Z^2 + epsilon) with small epsilon > 0.

## 3. Reciprocity Law

The core relationship:

```
dS + k* d ln C = 0  =>  S + k* ln C = const.     (1)
```

In information form, with a distribution p, define C[p] = exp[-H(p)/k*] where H is Shannon entropy (nats).

KL divergence and mutual information yield coherence ratios:

```
RER(p->q) = C[q]/C[p] = exp[-D_KL(p||q)/k*]      (2)

I(X; Y) = D_KL(p_XY || p_X p_Y) => C_XY = exp[-I/k*]   (3)
```

Thermodynamic projection (isothermal) gives the free-energy relation:

```
deltaG = -k*T delta(ln C)                          (4)
```

## 4. Universal Coherence Condition (UCC)

Local flow form:

```
d_t ln C = -div(J_C) + S_C,   J_C = -D_C grad(ln C)    (5)
```

with D_C > 0.

Energy-like dissipation under suitable boundary conditions:

```
sigma(t) = k* D_C integral(||grad ln C||^2 dV) >= 0     (6)
```

- [[FRC-200-001]] — Lambda operator foundations
- [[FRC-300-001]] — Witness magnitude framework

## 6. Key Results

1. Entropy and coherence are reciprocal: gaining one costs the other
2. The UCC provides a local flow equation for coherence dynamics
3. Free energy couples directly to coherence changes via deltaG = -k*T delta(ln C)
4. Dissipation is always non-negative (thermodynamic consistency)
