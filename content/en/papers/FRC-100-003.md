---# FRC 100.003 — Guided Wavefunction Collapse via Fractal Resonance

## 1. Introduction

The measurement problem remains the central unsolved puzzle of quantum mechanics. The Copenhagen interpretation postulates an instantaneous, stochastic "collapse" of the wavefunction upon observation, yet provides no physical mechanism for this transition. Many-Worlds avoids collapse entirely by accepting an ever-branching multiverse, while De Broglie-Bohm introduces pilot waves with non-local hidden variables.

This paper proposes a fourth path: collapse as a **deterministic phase-locking process** guided by the Lambda-field. In this framework, measurement is not a random snap from superposition to eigenstate but a fast, directed trajectory through phase space toward a resonant attractor.

## 2. The Problem with Stochastic Collapse

### 2.1 The Copenhagen Axiom

Standard quantum mechanics treats measurement as axiomatic:

| Aspect | Copenhagen Treatment |
|:---|:---|
| Trigger | Observation (undefined) |
| Mechanism | Instantaneous jump (postulated) |
| Outcome selection | Born rule $P = |\langle \phi_n | \psi \rangle|^2$ |
| Duration | Zero (discontinuous) |

This leaves three critical questions unanswered:

1. **What constitutes a "measurement"?** The observer-apparatus boundary is undefined.
2. **How does selection occur?** No dynamical process selects the outcome.
3. **Where does coherence go?** Decoherence explains the loss of interference but not the selection of a definite outcome.

### 2.2 Decoherence Is Necessary but Insufficient

Environmental decoherence suppresses off-diagonal elements of the density matrix, producing an improper mixture. But a mixture is not a selection—it describes an ensemble, not a single outcome. The "and-to-or" transition (from superposition to definite state) requires additional dynamics.

## 3. The FRC Collapse Mechanism

### 3.1 The Lambda-Field as a Guiding Potential

We introduce the Lambda-field ([[FRC-100-007]]) as the dynamical agent of collapse:

```
Lambda(x) = Lambda_0 ln C(x)
```

where $C(x)$ is the local coherence measure and $\Lambda_0 \approx 10^{-35}$ J is the coherence energy quantum.

The key insight: $\Lambda(x)$ defines a landscape in configuration space whose maxima correspond to the eigenstates of the measured observable.

### 3.2 Modified Dynamics

The wavefunction evolves according to the standard Schrodinger equation plus a non-unitary coherence term:

```
d|psi>/dt = -i H_hat |psi> + eta * grad_Lambda(|psi>)
```

where $\eta > 0$ is the coupling strength between the system and the coherence field. The second term represents the "pull" of the Lambda-field toward coherent eigenstates.

### 3.3 Phase-Locking Dynamics

In the phase representation $\psi = \sqrt{\rho} e^{i\phi}$, the collapse dynamics become transparent:

```
d(phi)/dt = -partial(H)/partial(rho) + eta * partial(Lambda)/partial(phi)
d(rho)/dt = partial(H)/partial(phi) + eta * partial(Lambda)/partial(rho)
```

The Lambda-gradient term drives the phases $\phi$ toward synchronization with the nearest eigenstate phase pattern—this is **phase-locking**.

## 4. Attractor Structure

### 4.1 Fixed Points

The fixed points of the collapse dynamics are the eigenstates $|\phi_n\rangle$ of the measured observable. Each eigenstate corresponds to a local maximum of the Lambda-field:

```
grad Lambda(|phi_n>) = 0,  Hessian negative definite
```

The basins of attraction partition the Hilbert space into regions, each flowing toward a definite eigenstate.

### 4.2 Basin Volumes and the Born Rule

The volume of each basin of attraction is proportional to $|\langle \phi_n | \psi_0 \rangle|^2$, where $|\psi_0\rangle$ is the initial state. This provides a dynamical derivation of the Born rule ([[FRC-100-006]]):

```
P(n) = Vol(Basin_n) / Vol(Total) = |<phi_n | psi_0>|^2
```

The Born rule emerges as a geometric property of the attractor landscape, not as a fundamental postulate.

### 4.3 Collapse Timescale

The characteristic timescale for collapse is:

```
tau_collapse ~ 1 / (eta * |grad Lambda|_max)
```

For typical quantum systems, this gives $\tau_{collapse} \sim 10^{-15}$ s, well below experimental resolution, explaining the apparent instantaneity of measurement.

## 5. Comparison with Other Interpretations

| Feature | Copenhagen | Many-Worlds | Bohm | FRC |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| Collapse occurs? | Yes (axiom) | No (branching) | No (guidance) | Yes (dynamical) |
| Mechanism | None | Decoherence | Pilot wave | Phase-locking |
| Born rule | Postulate | Derived (debated) | Equilibrium | Basin volumes |
| Hidden variables | None | None | Positions | Lambda-field |
| Non-local? | Implicit | No | Yes | Yes (phase) |
| Time of collapse | Instantaneous | N/A | N/A | $\tau \sim 10^{-15}$ s |

## 6. Numerical Demonstration

### 6.1 Two-Level System

For a qubit in superposition $|\psi\rangle = \alpha|0\rangle + \beta|1\rangle$, the phase-locking dynamics can be solved exactly. The Bloch sphere trajectory spirals toward either the north or south pole, with the dividing great circle located at $|\alpha|^2 = |\beta|^2 = 1/2$.

### 6.2 Stadium Billiard Collapse

Applying the collapse dynamics to the FRC-perturbed stadium billiard ([[FRC-100-002]]), we observe:

1. Initial superposition of eigenstates evolves under the Lambda-field
2. Phase-space vortices form around the dominant eigenstate
3. The system locks into a single eigenstate within $\tau_{collapse}$
4. The final state exhibits the $D \approx 1.90$ fractal signature

## 7. Experimental Signatures

The FRC collapse mechanism predicts deviations from standard quantum mechanics:

1. **Finite collapse time:** Ultrafast measurements ($< 10^{-15}$ s) should reveal intermediate states
2. **Born rule deviations:** Near the basin boundaries, $\delta P \in [10^{-4}, 10^{-3}]$ deviations are predicted under resonant driving ([[FRC-100-006]])
3. **Coherence echoes:** Post-measurement recovery of partial coherence under specific phase-reversal protocols

## 8. Conclusion

We have proposed a concrete dynamical mechanism for wavefunction collapse based on deterministic phase-locking driven by the Lambda-field. This approach:

- Resolves the measurement problem without introducing stochastic axioms
- Derives the Born rule from the geometry of attractor basins
- Predicts falsifiable deviations from standard quantum mechanics
- Unifies collapse with the broader FRC framework of fractal-resonant dynamics

Measurement is not a mystery—it is physics.
