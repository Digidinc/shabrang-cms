# FRC 100.003 — Guided Wavefunction Collapse

## Abstract
The measurement problem is resolved by treating 'collapse' as a fast, non-unitary evolution driven by the coherence field $\Lambda(x)$.

## The Mechanism
The system evolves according to:
$$ \frac{d|\psi\rangle}{dt} = -i\hat{H}|\psi\rangle + \nabla \Lambda(|\psi\rangle) $$
The second term represents the 'pull' of the coherence attractor.

## Conclusion
Collapse is a physical process of phase synchronization, not an axiomatic discontinuity.
