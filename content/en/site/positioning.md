description: "How FRC compares to Bohm, Copenhagen, Many-Worlds, IIT, and other theories of physics and consciousness."
comparisons:
  - theory: "Copenhagen Interpretation"
    axis: "Probabilistic + Reductionist"
    relation: "FRC derives Born rule as emergent, not fundamental. Wavefunction collapse is guided by coherence attractors, not observer-triggered."
    link: "frc-vs-copenhagen"
  - theory: "Bohmian Mechanics"
    axis: "Deterministic + Reductionist"
    relation: "Shares determinism. FRC replaces the pilot wave with a scalar coherence field Λ(x) that is thermodynamically grounded."
    link: "frc-vs-bohmian-mechanics"
  - theory: "Many-Worlds (Everett)"
    axis: "Deterministic + Holistic"
    relation: "FRC selects a single outcome via attractor dynamics rather than branching into all possibilities."
    link: "frc-vs-simulation-hypothesis"
  - theory: "IIT (Tononi)"
    axis: "Holistic"
    relation: "FRC uses coherence C instead of integrated information Φ. Both are scalar measures but FRC connects directly to physics."
    link: "frc-vs-iit"
  - theory: "Orch-OR (Penrose-Hameroff)"
    axis: "Quantum + Consciousness"
    relation: "FRC replaces objective reduction with resonant attractors. No microtubule dependency — coherence operates at all scales."
    link: "frc-vs-orch-or"
  - theory: "Global Workspace Theory"
    axis: "Cognitive"
    relation: "Compatible as a μ₃-level description. FRC provides the underlying physics across all μ-levels."
    link: "frc-vs-active-inference"
  - theory: "Stephen Wolfram (Ruliad)"
    axis: "Computational"
    relation: "Wolfram focuses on computational equivalence; FRC focuses on thermodynamic coherence and the conservation of phase."

# Comparative Analysis

The Fractal Resonance Coherence (FRC) framework occupies a unique position in the landscape of modern science. It sits in the **Deterministic + Holistic** quadrant: deterministic dynamics at the microstate level, but holistic coherence across scales.
