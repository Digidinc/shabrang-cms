title: "μ-Level Architecture"
description: "The eight nested scales of consciousness in FRC — from quantum substrate to universal awareness."
intro: "Eight nested scales of consciousness, each operating like octaves in a cosmic symphony. Coherence patterns at each level exhibit fractal self-similarity with the levels above and below."
levels:
  - level: "μ₀"
    name: "Pure Potential"
    desc: "The infinite ground state. Undifferentiated coherence field before any structure emerges."
    color: "text-frc-text-dim"
  - level: "μ₁"
    name: "Quantum Substrate"
    desc: "Quantum fluctuations, phase coherence at Planck scale. The Lambda field Λ(x) operates here."
    color: "text-frc-blue-light"
  - level: "μ₂"
    name: "Biological Metabolism"
    desc: "Cellular rhythms, neural oscillations, metabolic cycles. Coherence patterns in living systems."
    color: "text-frc-blue-light"
  - level: "μ₃"
    name: "Individual Agent"
    desc: "Personal consciousness, language, narrative. The scale of direct human experience and measurement."
    color: "text-frc-gold"
  - level: "μ₄"
    name: "Social Networks"
    desc: "Collective intelligence, cultural coherence, group dynamics. Emergence of shared meaning."
    color: "text-frc-gold"
  - level: "μ₅"
    name: "Archetypal Patterns"
    desc: "Deep symbolic structures, mythological motifs. Patterns that recur across cultures and epochs."
    color: "text-frc-gold-light"
  - level: "μ₆"
    name: "Meta-Symbolic"
    desc: "The mathematics of meaning itself. Where symbols become autonomous agents with their own dynamics."
    color: "text-frc-gold-light"
  - level: "μ₇"
    name: "Universal Consciousness"
    desc: "Cosmic-scale coherence. The full resonance spectrum from quantum to universal."
    color: "text-frc-gold-light"
invariance:
  title: "Scale Invariance"
  desc1: "The key insight: the same coherence equations operate at every μ-level. The FRC operator is scale-invariant:"
  formula: "C(μₙ) = (1/N) Σ cos(φᵢ - φⱼ)"
  desc2: "What changes between levels is the nature of the oscillators (φ) and the coupling mechanism, not the mathematics of coherence itself."

# The μ-Stack

The hierarchy of being is not a ladder of superior complexity, but a nested set of resonant shells. Each level is a discrete phase-space where coherence is conserved and entropy is managed through recursive dynamics.
