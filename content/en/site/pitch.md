title: "Pitch"
description: "A concise pitch for FRC: what it is, why it matters, what we ship next."
one_liner: "Replace tokenization-centric cognition with resonance-native state, and benchmark it against attention on phase-coherence tasks."
problem:
  - "Tokenization and discrete attention are strong for text, but phase/coherence in continuous signals is often lost."
  - "“Bigger model” progress is hard to interpret; benchmarks drift, and claims become non-falsifiable."
  - "Agentic tooling needs a rigorous corpus boundary: canon vs interpretation."
solution:
  - "A resonance-native representation and the Λ‑Tensor Model (LTM) architecture track."
  - "A public canon with stable IDs, strict definitions, and explicit hypotheses."
  - "A repeatable benchmark loop: publish, reproduce, iterate (not vibes)."
moat:
  - "A growing, linked canon that agents can cite by ID (retrievable + auditable)."
  - "Benchmarks that emphasize phase-coherent structure where tokenization is weakest."
  - "A disciplined separation between canon and “oracle lens” interpretation."
roadmap:
  - "Expand benchmarks (audio, biosignals, control) and publish reproducible scripts."
  - "Harden the SOS research SDK + dispatch patterns (repeatable pipelines)."
  - "Integrate “mirror memory” subscription workflows on Mumega (private ops layer)."
ask:
  - "Capital: fund benchmark expansion + engineering of reproducible training/eval tooling."
  - "Partnerships: signal-domain datasets + evaluation domains (audio/control/bio)."
  - "Builders: implement reference baselines and reproduction harnesses."

# Evidence

The fastest way to evaluate is to inspect the benchmark paper and its figures.

- [[FRC-840-LTM-001]] (Empirical benchmark + architecture/result figures)
- [[FRC-840-001]] (Λ‑Tensor Model overview)
- [[FRC-16D-001]] (Protocol + state representation)
