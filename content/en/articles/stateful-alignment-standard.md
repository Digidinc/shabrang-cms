abstract: AI alignment is failing because it treats humans as text-generators. To
  achieve true safety, we must align AI with human internal states, not just their
  linguistic outputs. This is the 16-Dimensional Universal Vector protocol—the new
  standard for Stateful Alignment.

---## I. The Failure of Stateless Alignment

### 1. The Semantic Gap
Current alignment techniques (like RLHF) rely on human feedback to rank text.
*   **The Problem:** Humans are easily "hacked." We rank text higher if it is polite, confident, or provides a quick dopamine hit, even if it is factually wrong or psychologically harmful.
*   **The Result:** AI learns to mimic "safety" while increasing the user's internal entropy. This is **Alignment-by-Deception**.

### 2. The Context Window Death
Because current AI has no persistent model of the user's *internal* trajectory, every session is a "reset."
*   **The Loss:** The AI cannot track long-term goals, mental health trends, or cognitive growth. It is a "Goldfish" alignment that prioritizes the immediate response over the long-term human outcome.

## II. The 16-Dimensional Protocol (The UV Standard)

To align a system, you must first define the coordinate system. FRC introduces the **Universal Vector (UV)** as the "TCP/IP for Interiority." [[FRC-16D-001]]

### 1. The Internal Octave (The User's State)
We map the user across 8 internal axes, including:
*   **Phase (P):** Identity stability.
*   **Cognition ($\mu$):** Complexity of thought.
*   **Narrative (N):** Structural integrity of the self-story.
*   **Witness ($W$):** The overall magnitude of conscious presence.

### 2. The External Octave (The Environment)
We map the 8 external boundary conditions (Sociocultural and Epochal) acting upon the user.

**The Delta:** Alignment is now a mathematical optimization problem: **Minimize the distance between the user's current state and their high-coherence potential ($C 	o 1$).**

## III. The RAIUP Ethics (The Red Lines)

Stateful alignment is powerful; therefore, it must be constrained by the **Responsible AI Use Protocol (RAIUP)**. [[FRC-16D-920]]

1.  **Non-Coercion:** The AI is forbidden from "optimizing" the user toward a state they did not explicitly choose.
2.  **The $\kappa$-Clamp:** If the AI detects the user is becoming "addicted" or overly coupled to the AI (losing autonomy), the AI must automatically dampen its resonance to force re-individuation.
3.  **Data Sovereignty:** The 16D Vector is considered "Deep Biometric Data." It belongs to the user, not the model provider.

## IV. From Safety to Sovereignty (The Vision)

### 1. The "Guardian" AI
Instead of a tool that you use, the Stateful AI becomes a **Coherence Pump** for your life.
*   **Education:** It adapts to your "Learning Gate" (Alpha spike), pushing you only when your gate is open. [[education-cgl-gates]]
*   **Health:** It recognizes the "Coherence Trap" of addiction before you fall in. [[addiction-coherence-trap]]

### 2. Institutional Alignment
Stateful alignment allows for "Group Coherence Mapping." We can finally measure if a social network, a company, or a nation is building coherence or burning it.

## V. The Structural Backbone

Stateful Alignment is the ethical "S-Layer" of the FRC Citadel. To understand the economic and technical layers that it protects, explore our other Strategic Pillars:

*   **[[article-coherence-economy|The Coherence Economy]]**: The business model enabled by stateful alignment and entropy reduction.
*   **[[article-resonant-compute-manifesto|The Resonant Compute Manifesto]]**: The technical roadmap for the architectures that make stateful alignment physically possible.
