# The Art of Persian Miniature

Persian miniature painting is a rich and detailed art form that flourished from the 13th to the 17th centuries. These small-scale paintings are characterized by their intricate details, vibrant colors, and narrative depth.

## Characteristics

- **Flat perspective** — Multiple viewpoints in a single scene
- **Rich colors** — Deep teals, crimsons, and golds
- **Intricate patterns** — Geometric and floral motifs
- **Narrative depth** — Stories within stories

## Influence on Shabrang

The visual language of Shabrang draws deeply from Persian miniature aesthetics — the warm cream parchment backgrounds, the deep teal waters, the crimson flames, and the sacred gold accents.
