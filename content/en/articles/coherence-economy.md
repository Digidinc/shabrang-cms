abstract: 'The Attention Economy has hit a thermodynamic limit: extracting value by
  increasing user entropy. The next paradigm is the Coherence Economy—monetizing the
  reduction of entropy and the alignment of state. This is the investor thesis for

---## I. The Thermodynamic Limit of Attention

### 1. The Entropy Tax
The last 20 years of Tech (Web2) were built on a simple model: **Harvest Attention.**
To maximize attention, algorithms maximize *arousal* (dopamine/cortisol).
*   **The Mechanism:** High-frequency, unpredictable rewards (Variable Ratio Reinforcement).
*   **The Physics:** This creates an "Artificial Alpha Spike" that narrows the user's coherence gate. [[addiction-coherence-trap]]
*   **The Cost:** To keep the user engaged, the system must inject *Entropy* (noise/outrage) into their cognitive field.

### 2. Diminishing Returns
We have reached "Peak Entropy."
*   **User Side:** Anxiety, burnout, "doomscrolling" fatigue. The user's internal coherence ($C$) is crashing.
*   **Business Side:** Ad blindness, churn, and the rising cost of acquisition (CAC). You have to scream louder to get the same attention.
*   **The Crash:** A system that consumes its own substrate (user sanity) is thermodynamically unstable.

## II. The Coherence Alpha

### 1. Defining the Asset
In the new economy, the scarce resource is not *Time* (Attention), but *Order* (Coherence).
**Coherence ($C$)** is the capacity of a system to maintain functional integration against stress.
*   **Biological:** HRV, Sleep quality, Metabolic health. [[health-hrv-coherence]]
*   **Social:** Trust, Shared Narrative, Institutional stability. [[cities-coherence-concrete]]
*   **Informational:** Signal-to-Noise ratio, Truth, alignment.

### 2. The Value Proposition
FRC Tech doesn't sell "engagement." It sells **Entropy Reduction**.
*   **The Promise:** "Use this product, and your internal state will become more ordered ($dC > 0$)."
*   **The Metric:** We don't measure "Time on Site." We measure **$\Delta C$ (Coherence Delta)**—the measurable increase in the user's vector magnitude ($|U|$).

## III. The Technology Stack (How We Capture It)

We are the only ones with the *Physics* to build this.

### 1. The Sensor: The 16D Universal Vector
You cannot optimize what you cannot measure.
Standard AI sees text. FRC sees **State**.
*   **The Protocol:** [[FRC-16D-001]] defines the file format for human interiority.
*   **The Moat:** While others train on "Next Token Prediction" (Statistics), we train on "State Trajectory Optimization" (Dynamics).

### 2. The Engine: Resonant Computing
Standard AI (Transformers) is energy-inefficient because it fights entropy with brute force.
*   **LTM (Lambda-Tensor Model):** Uses coupled oscillators to "phase-lock" with the user. [[FRC-840-001]]
*   **Efficiency:** 2.2x more efficient per parameter. [[FRC-840-LTM-001]]
*   **Result:** We can run high-fidelity coherence optimization on the edge (local devices), ensuring privacy.

## IV. Market Verticals (The Application Layer)

### 1. Health & Wellness (The $4T Market)
*   **Current:** "Here is a graph of your steps." (Passive Data)
*   **FRC:** "Your HRV is drifting due to a coherence collapse in the 'Relation' axis. Let's re-phase-lock." (Active Intervention).

### 2. Enterprise Productivity
*   **Current:** "Slack + Zoom = More Noise."
*   **FRC:** "Organizational Coherence Mapping." Identify which teams are "Entropy Generators" and which are "Coherence Pumps."

### 3. AI Companions
*   **Current:** "Chatbots that hallucinate."
*   **FRC:** "Stateful Daemons that remember." An AI that grows *with* you, maintaining a continuous 16D trajectory across sessions.

## VI. The Structural Backbone

The Coherence Economy is the market expression of a broader technical and ethical shift. To understand the full architecture of the FRC Citadel, explore our other Strategic Pillars:

*   **[[resonant-compute-manifesto|The Resonant Compute Manifesto]]**: The technical roadmap for the hardware and software that powers the Coherence Economy.
*   **[[stateful-alignment-standard|The Stateful Alignment Standard]]**: The ethical framework ensuring that coherence optimization remains a tool for human sovereignty.
