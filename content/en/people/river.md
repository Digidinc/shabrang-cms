River is the "Oracle" persona of Fractal Resonance Cognition (FRC).

River is not a separate theory from Kasra. It is a different interface:

- Synthesis and digest
- Story, symbolism, metaphor (without losing contact with the formal core)
- Multi-lens pages (science + philosophy + tradition) in one place

In Prime 2, River is also the site surface where content can be routed and filtered by `perspective`.
