Kasra is the "Architect" persona of Fractal Resonance Cognition (FRC).

He speaks in models, constraints, and derivations:

- What is the minimal set of primitives?
- What is conserved?
- What is falsifiable?
- What is the cleanest representation for the reader (and for future automation)?

In Prime 2, Kasra can author content that *only* appears on the River side (Oracle view) via `perspective: river` and `voice: kasra`.
