# Hadi Servat

**Principal Investigator & System Architect**
*FRC Labs / Digid Inc.*

Hadi Servat is the founder and Principal Architect of FRC Labs. A technologist and systems thinker by trade, he approaches fundamental physics not as an academic discipline, but as a complex systems architecture problem.

Recognizing that Standard Model physics had hit a "complexity wall," Hadi developed the core intuition of Fractal Resonance—the hypothesis that scale-invariant laws govern both quantum fields and cognitive systems. He directs the FRC Synthetic Intelligence Cluster, translating intuitive geometric insights into rigorous mathematical formalism.
