abstract: "A River-side frame: poetry as coherence compression, propaganda as forced phase-locking, and language as coherence transfer between minds."
question: "Why do some words cut and others heal (in FRC terms)?"
short_answer: "Great language is low-entropy input producing high-coherence output (compression -> decompression). Propaganda uses the same mechanism but narrows the gate instead of widening it."

    answer: "Treat language as coherence reproduction: a pattern in one mind is transmitted via sound/text and reconstructed in another mind."

# Language: Coherence Made Audible

Language is coherence made audible.

Not metaphorically. Words can produce physical chills. The brain treats a perfectly constructed sentence like a reward event. Because it is one.

A great line of poetry is a coherence compression event: it takes a complex, multi-dimensional experience and phase-locks it into a handful of syllables. The brain receives the compressed pattern, decompresses it, and the sudden expansion of meaning registers as reward — alpha spike — learning gate open.

Bad writing is high entropy: hard to decode, little coherence returned. Great writing is low entropy input producing high coherence output.

## Propaganda

Propaganda is forced phase-locking. It uses rhythm, repetition, emotional resonance — but narrows the coherence gate instead of widening it. A good poem opens you to more reality. A good slogan closes you to everything except one message.

Same mechanism. Opposite thermodynamic direction.

## Translation

Translation is coherence transfer across substrates. Some poems survive translation (structural coherence), others die (phonological coherence).

## Farsi and the Liquid Fortress

Persian poetry isn't decorative; it's structural. The language became a high-bandwidth coherence carrier. Libraries can burn and walls can fall, but if the language survives, the coherence field survives.
