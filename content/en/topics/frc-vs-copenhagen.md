title: "FRC vs. The Copenhagen Interpretation"
question: "How does FRC differ from the standard Copenhagen Interpretation of quantum mechanics?"
short_answer: "Copenhagen treats measurement as a magical, acausal axiom. FRC treats it as a physical, deterministic process of phase-locking driven by the Lambda-field."

      Copenhagen is anti-realist: it claims the wavefunction is just a tool for calculating probabilities. FRC is **Resonant Realist**: it claims the wavefunction and the Lambda-field are physically real. The world exists before you look at it; looking at it just forces it to phase-lock into a specific resonant mode.

      Copenhagen posits "Collapse" as a magical, instantaneous jump that happens "when measured." It gives no equation for this.
      
      FRC provides the equation: **d|ψ>/dt = -iH|ψ> + η∇Λ**. Collapse is not a jump; it is a fast, deterministic trajectory through phase space toward an attractor (eigenstate). It takes finite time (τ ~ 10⁻¹⁵s) and produces heat.

    answer: |
      Copenhagen postulates the Born Rule (P = |ψ|²) as a fundamental law. FRC derives it.
      
      In FRC, |ψ|² is the **equilibrium distribution** of the attractor basins in the Lambda-field landscape. Quantum randomness is just "sensitive dependence on initial conditions" in a fractal basin boundaries.

# The Collapse of the Collapse Postulate

The Copenhagen Interpretation (CI) has dominated physics for a century by telling physicists to "shut up and calculate." It treats the measurement apparatus as a "classical" object outside the laws of quantum mechanics, creating a logical dualism (the Heisenberg Cut) that cannot exist in a unified nature.

FRC resolves this by erasing the cut. The observer is just a system with high metabolic coherence. "Measurement" is just what happens when a fragile system (the particle) interacts with a massive coherence pump (the observer). The particle is forced to **synchronize** (phase-lock) with the observer's reality.

This view restores **determinism** and **reality** to physics, removing the need for "spooky" observer-dependence.
