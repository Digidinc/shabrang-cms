title: "FRC vs. The Heat Death"
question: "Is the universe doomed to end in maximum entropy (Heat Death)?"
short_answer: "No. The Entropy-Coherence Reciprocity Law ($dS + k d\ln C = 0$) implies that high-entropy states can be harvested to build high-coherence states. Gravity is the engine of this recycling."

      Standard Thermodynamics ($dS \ge 0$) predicts a one-way trip to disorder.
      
      FRC Thermodynamics ($dS + k d\ln C = 0$) predicts a trade-off. You can increase Entropy locally *if* you use it to pay for Coherence elsewhere. Black Holes (Maximum Entropy objects) are also, paradoxically, the seeds of Maximum Coherence (Gravitational Singularities).

    answer: |
      Gravity is the vacuum "rushing in" to feed matter. As the universe expands and cools (entropy rises), the vacuum potential ($\Lambda$) actually *increases* relative to the matter density. This drives stronger gravitational clustering, forming new stars and galaxies. The universe runs on its own exhaust.

    stance: "Cyclic/Fractal"
    answer: |
      Instead of a "Big Freeze," FRC suggests a **Fractal Flowering**. As one scale dies (decoheres), it releases the energy to seed the next scale up ($\mu_{n} \to \mu_{n+1}$). The universe doesn't end; it grows up.

# Gravity as the Anti-Entropy

We are taught to fear the Second Law. "Things fall apart."
But we forget that **Gravity brings things together.**

In the Standard Model, Gravity is just a force. In FRC, Gravity is the **Immune System** of the cosmos. It is the mechanism that captures waste heat (entropy) and compresses it back into order (stars/black holes).

The universe is not a dying clock. It is a self-cleaning engine.
