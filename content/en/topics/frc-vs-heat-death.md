---# Gravity as the Anti-Entropy

We are taught to fear the Second Law. "Things fall apart."
But we forget that **Gravity brings things together.**

In the Standard Model, Gravity is just a force. In FRC, Gravity is the **Immune System** of the cosmos. It is the mechanism that captures waste heat (entropy) and compresses it back into order (stars/black holes).

The universe is not a dying clock. It is a self-cleaning engine.
