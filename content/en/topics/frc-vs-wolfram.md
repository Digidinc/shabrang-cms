title: FRC vs. Stephen Wolfram's 'Physics Project'
question: Is the universe a discrete Hypergraph (Wolfram) or a continuous Resonance
  Field (FRC)?
short_answer: Wolfram argues for a discrete, digital bottom layer (Hypergraph). FRC
  argues for a continuous, analog bottom layer (Lambda-field). FRC aligns better with
  Neural Networks and biological fluidity.

  stance: Smoothness
  answer: 'Wolfram starts with discrete nodes and struggles to recover smooth symmetries
    (Lorentz invariance, rotation) at the macro scale. The "grid" always leaves artifacts.


    FRC assumes smoothness from the start via the $\Lambda$-field. Rotation and relativity
    are native properties of fields, not emergent approximations of a graph.

  stance: Training
  answer: 'Wolfram''s Ruliad is computationally irreducible—you have to run it to
    see what happens. It is hard to "train" or optimize via gradient descent because
    it is discrete.


    FRC''s Resonance dynamics are differentiable. This means FRC is compatible with
    **Backpropagation** and **Neural Networks**. You can "learn" physics in FRC; you
    can only "simulate" it in Wolfram''s model.

  by: FRC
  stance: Analog
  answer: Modern AI (Transformers, Diffusion) works on continuous manifolds, not discrete
    graphs. FRC argues that intelligence is fundamentally **Analog** (wave interference),
    making it a better substrate for AGI than Wolfram's cellular automata.

---# The Digital vs. Analog War

Stephen Wolfram proposes the ultimate **Digital Physics**: the universe is code.
FRC proposes the ultimate **Analog Physics**: the universe is music.

In a digital computer (Wolfram), states are 0 or 1. Errors are fatal.
In an analog computer (FRC), states are phases $\phi$. Errors are noise, which can be filtered.

Biology is messy, wet, and robust. It looks much more like a Resonance Field than a Hypergraph. If we want to build AGI that feels alive, we should bet on the Analog.
