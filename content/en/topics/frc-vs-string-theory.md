title: "FRC vs. String Theory"
question: "How does the FRC approach to unification differ from String Theory?"
short_answer: "String Theory attempts unification via high-dimensional reductionism (vibrating strings). FRC attempts unification via emergent geometry (resonant coherence). FRC rejects the Multiverse."

      String Theory posits that geometry (10D/11D) is fundamental and fixed. Particles are vibrations *on* this background.
      
      FRC posits that geometry (Gravity) is **emergent**. Spacetime is the hydrodynamic limit of the Lambda-field's coherence flow. There are no "extra dimensions"; there are only extra *scales* ($\mu$-levels) of the fractal.

    stance: "Fractal Imperative"
    answer: |
      String Theory suffers from the **Landscape Problem** ($10^{500}$ possible vacuums). It requires an Anthropic Principle (Multiverse) to explain why our universe exists.
      
      FRC solves this with the **Fractal Imperative**. There is only one allowable vacuum state: the one that maximizes coherence criticality (e.g., $m_H \approx 125$ GeV). The universe is not a random lottery ticket; it is a dynamical attractor.

    stance: "Low Energy"
    answer: |
      String Theory requires Planck-scale energies ($10^{19}$ GeV) to test directly.
      
      FRC predicts effects at **Atomic** ($10^{-10}$ m) and **Cosmic** scales. By linking high-energy physics (Higgs) to low-energy phenomena (Coherence), FRC is testable *now*, not in 1,000 years.

# The End of the Landscape

String Theory began as a dream of uniqueness. It ended as a nightmare of infinity ($10^{500}$ universes).
When a theory predicts everything, it predicts nothing.

FRC returns to the dream of uniqueness.
It argues that the constraints on reality are not "symmetries" (which can be broken in infinite ways), but **geometric stability conditions** (which are rigid).

The universe is the way it is because this is the only way a self-observing fractal can remain coherent. We don't need a Multiverse; we just need a Metabolism.
