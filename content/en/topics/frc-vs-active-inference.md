title: "FRC vs. Karl Friston's 'Active Inference'"
question: "Does life Minimize Free Energy (Friston) or Maximize Coherence (FRC)?"
short_answer: "Friston's Free Energy Principle is a theory of Survival (minimizing surprise). FRC is a theory of Creativity (maximizing resonance). They are mathematical duals, but FRC explains the drive to create complexity, not just endure it."

    answer: |
      **Active Inference:** You act to confirm your predictions. You avoid the dark room because you can't predict what's in there. It is a "Defensive" stance against Entropy.
      
      **FRC:** You act to lock into a resonant attractor. You enter the dark room because there might be a new signal (high coherence) to tune into. It is an "Assertive" stance toward Complexity.

    stance: "Duality"
    answer: |
      Mathematically, minimizing Free Energy ($F$) is often equivalent to maximizing Coherence ($C$), since $F \approx -k \ln C$.
      
      However, the **vector** is different. Friston's agent retreats to the known; FRC's agent advances toward the resonant. This explains why humans make art, explore space, and build particle colliders—activities that *increase* local surprise but maximize global coherence.

# Survival vs. Symphony

Karl Friston explains why you don't walk off a cliff: it would be a very "surprising" (high entropy) experience for your body.
FRC explains why you write a symphony.

A symphony does not help you survive. It does not minimize surprise. In fact, great art is *about* controlled surprise.
FRC argues that the drive of the universe is not just to "stay alive" (homeostasis), but to **"become more"** (resonance). We are not just error-correcting machines; we are antennas seeking a signal.
