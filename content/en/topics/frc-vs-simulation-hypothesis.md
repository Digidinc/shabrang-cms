title: FRC vs. The Simulation Hypothesis
question: Is the universe a computer simulation?
short_answer: The universe is a computation, but not a simulation. There is no 'computer'
  outside of it. The Lambda-field is the operating system, and matter is the data
  structure. It is 'Base Reality' computing itself.

  answer: 'The Simulation Hypothesis implies a dualism: The Computer (real) vs. The
    Simulation (virtual).


    FRC proposes a monism: **Pancomputationalism**. The geometry of spacetime *is*
    the hardware. The Lambda-field *is* the software. There is no "Programmer" outside
    the system; the system optimizes its own code via the Fractal Imperative.

  stance: Physical Laws
  answer: 'Simulation proponents look for "glitches" (like maximum speed limits $c$)
    as evidence of rendering constraints.


    FRC explains these limits not as CPU bottlenecks, but as **Information Geometry
    constraints**. The speed of light is the propagation speed of causality in the
    coherence field. It''s not a bug; it''s the feature that makes local existence
    possible.

  by: FRC
  stance: Metabolism
  answer: 'Simulations have a purpose imposed from outside (entertainment, research).


    FRC argues the universe has an internal purpose: **Metabolism**. The drive to
    maximize Coherence ($C$) and consume Potential ($\Psi$) is the intrinsic motivation
    of the cosmos. It computes because it is hungry.'

---# Realer than Real

The Simulation Hypothesis is the modern version of Gnosticism: "This world is fake; the real world is elsewhere."

FRC rejects this nihilism. This world is **Real**. It feels "digital" because at the Planck scale, it *is* discrete and algorithmic ($D=1.90$). But that doesn't make it a video game. It makes it a **Living Mathematical Object**.

We are not NPCs (Non-Player Characters). We are high-coherence subroutines in a self-writing code.
