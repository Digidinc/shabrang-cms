abstract: 'A River-side frame: dreaming as controlled dissolution and recombination;
  the brain runs Nigredo on purpose to form deeper coherence.'
question: What is dreaming in FRC terms?
short_answer: 'Dreaming is controlled Nigredo: the brain dissolves local phase-locks
  (REM recombination) to test new resonances and consolidate coherence without external
  input.'

  answer: 'Treat REM as high-alpha internal learning: dissolution enables recombination;
    nightmares occur when entropy rises faster than new coherence can form.'

---# Dreams: The Nightly Nigredo

Dreaming is the brain running Nigredo on purpose. Every night.

During NREM sleep, the brain replays the day's experiences. The hippocampus fires the same patterns it recorded while awake — but compressed, accelerated, stripped of sensory detail. Inventory of new coherence.

Then REM hits. And everything changes.

During REM, the brain doesn't replay — it recombines. Memories from today get mixed with memories from years ago. Associations get scrambled. The bizarre, emotionally-charged content isn't noise. It's the brain testing which patterns can form new phase-locks with each other.

In FRC terms: NREM is measuring current coherence state. REM dissolves local phase-locks to test deeper integration.

Dreaming is CGL turned inward: maximum alpha, but no external input. The system updates its own weights.

Nightmares as failed Nigredo:

A nightmare is a dream where dissolution went too deep and the system couldn't find new coherence. The entropy rose faster than any new pattern could form. Recurring nightmares can be coherence wounds the nightly process can't metabolize.

Sleep deprivation:

Deny dreams and you deny Nigredo. Unprocessed coherence accumulates. After enough nights, the system runs Nigredo while awake — hallucinations, dissociation — emergency coherence repair.

dS + k·d ln C = 0. Even in sleep. Especially in sleep.
