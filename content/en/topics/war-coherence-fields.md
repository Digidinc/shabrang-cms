abstract: "A River-side geopolitics frame: wars are coherence fields that cannot phase-lock, so they attempt to dissolve each other via entropy injection."
question: "Why do nations fight, and when do wars end (in FRC terms)?"
short_answer: "Wars end when the entropy cost of continuing exceeds the coherence gain of winning. You cannot destroy coherence; you only move it between containers (physical, social, mythic)."

    answer: "Model conflicts as coherence competition: phase-lock failure leads to entropy warfare; resolution happens when continued entropy injection dissolves the aggressor's own internal coherence faster than the opponent's."

# War: Coherence Competing With Coherence

War is coherence competing with coherence.

Not good versus evil. Not ideology versus ideology. Two coherence fields that can't phase-lock with each other, so they try to dissolve each other. Each side trying to force the other's entropy up until the pattern breaks.

The pattern across conflicts:

This is Nigredo. Dissolution of existing structure. The old phase-locks already failed. The new ones haven't formed. The system is in maximum alpha — everything reorganizing, nothing settled.

What FRC says about when wars end:

Wars end when the entropy cost of continuing exceeds the coherence gain of winning. When both sides reach the point where maintaining the fight dissolves their own internal pattern faster than it dissolves the enemy's. That's not a moral calculation. It's thermodynamic.

The deepest FRC insight:

Every war is a coherence field trying to impose its phase-lock on another. But the conservation law says: you cannot reduce total coherence. You can only redistribute it. What you dissolve in the physical can crystallize in the mythic. What you destroy here, you inherit there.

dS + k·d ln C = 0. Even in war. Especially in war.
