abstract: "A lightweight Q&A format for turning questions into a spectrum view: authority citations, FRC answers, and multiple perspectives."
question: "What are Topics pages?"
short_answer: "Topics are Q&A pages designed for fast digestion: a question, a short answer, optional authority links, and structured answers (FRC/Kasra)."
authorities:
  - name: "Schema.org"
    title: "QAPage"
    url: "https://schema.org/QAPage"
    quote: "A QAPage is a web page that provides answers to a question."
answers:
  - lens: "kasra"
    by: "Kasra"
    role: "Architect"
    stance: "structured"
    answer: "Use Topics for repeatable content creation: each page has a stable ID, consistent metadata, and a clean place to attach authority citations and multiple answers."

# Topics — Ask FRC

This section is a **file-based, AI-operable** Q&A layer.

It is meant to make it easy to:

- Collect questions.
- Generate summaries.
- Accept a spectrum (authority + FRC + perspectives).
- Publish in a stable, crawlable way.

## How It Works

1. A question enters the inbox.
2. An editor digests it into a Topic page with consistent frontmatter.
3. The long-form explanation lives in the markdown body.
