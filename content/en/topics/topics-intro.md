# Topics — Ask FRC

This section is a **file-based, AI-operable** Q&A layer.

It is meant to make it easy to:

- Collect questions.
- Generate summaries.
- Accept a spectrum (authority + FRC + perspectives).
- Publish in a stable, crawlable way.

## How It Works

1. A question enters the inbox.
2. River (or Kasra) digests it into a Topic page with consistent frontmatter.
3. The long-form explanation lives in the markdown body.
