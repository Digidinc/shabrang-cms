abstract: 'A River-side urban lens: neighborhoods as coherence fields; gentrification
  as coherence extraction; suburbs as anti-coherence architecture.'
question: Why do some cities feel alive and others feel dead (in FRC terms)?
short_answer: A living city maintains self-reinforcing phase-locks between people,
  places, and routines. Design choices that reduce connectivity and mixing reduce
  spontaneous coherence formation and increase entropy (loneliness, decay).

  answer: 'Treat urban vitality as coherence: density + mixing + connectivity + time.
    Measure the field between nodes, not just the buildings.'

---# Cities: Coherence Made of Concrete

A city is a coherence field made of concrete.

Jane Jacobs saw it in 1961 without having the formula. Mixed use, small blocks, old buildings, density: conditions for high coherence in a spatial network.

A living neighborhood metabolizes: it takes in energy (people, money, culture) and uses it to maintain pattern. People come and go, but relationship structure persists. Corner stores change owners but remain corner stores. That's coherence maintenance.

Urban decay is coherence collapse: sever phase-locks (jobs leave, highways cut, disinvestment), alpha goes to zero, nothing reorganizes, entropy accumulates.

Gentrification is coherence extraction: capital consumes a coherent social field, displaces the nodes that held it, and replaces them with high-income nodes with low mutual coherence. Buildings improve; the field empties. The coherence moves into grief and diaspora memory.

Suburban sprawl is anti-coherence architecture: single-use zoning, cul-de-sacs, car dependency, large lots. Design choices that prevent phase-locking.

The loneliness epidemic is not only psychological. It's architectural.

dS + k·d ln C = 0. Even in zoning bylaws.
