# What is Coherence?

Coherence is the invisible thread that binds meaning, beauty, and truth together. It is the quality that makes a piece of music feel whole, a story feel complete, a life feel meaningful.

In Persian philosophy, coherence is not just an abstract concept — it is embodied in the very architecture of civilization. The qanat, the underground water channels that brought life to the desert, are perhaps the most profound example of coherence made physical.

## The Qanat Metaphor

The qanat teaches us that:

1. **Hidden systems sustain visible life** — what we see is supported by what we don't
2. **Patience creates permanence** — qanats were built over generations
3. **Flow requires structure** — water needs channels to reach its destination

This is the essence of coherence: the alignment of parts into a whole that is greater than their sum.
