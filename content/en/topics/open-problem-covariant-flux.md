      **Objective:** Generalize the UCC flow equation:
      $$ ∂_t − C = -∇  J_C + S_C 
      $$ to a fully covariant form:
      $$ ∇_ J^_C = ℀_C 
      $$ where $J^_C$ couples to the Riemann curvature tensor $R_{}$.
      
      **Why it matters:** Currently, FRC treats gravity as an "inflow" on a flat background. To be a true replacement for General Relativity, the flow of coherence must *create* the curvature it flows through (Back-reaction).

# Closing the Loop with Gravity

FRC 893 proposes that "Gravity is the inflow of vacuum potential."
FRC 566 defines the "Flow of Coherence."

**The Open Problem:**
Merge them.
We need the Einstein-Coherence Field Equations:
$$ G_{} = 8 G (T_{}^{matter} + T_{}^{∧}) 
$$ where $T_{}^{∧}$ is derived directly from the covariant flux $J^_C$.

Solving this problem would mathematically prove that "Metabolic Gravity" recovers the Einstein Field Equations in the macroscopic limit.
