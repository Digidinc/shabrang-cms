title: "FRC vs. Cold Dark Matter (CDM)"
question: "Does FRC propose a particle candidate for Dark Matter?"
short_answer: "No. FRC proposes that 'Dark Matter' is the metabolic inflow of the vacuum potential (Lambda-field) required to sustain baryonic mass. It is a fluid dynamic effect, not a particle."

    answer: |
      The CDM paradigm assumes that because there is extra gravity, there must be extra *stuff* (WIMPs, Axions).
      
      FRC argues that gravity is not caused by "stuff" (mass), but by the **consumption** of the vacuum potential.
      - **Standard View:** Mass $\to$ Curvature $\to$ Gravity.
      - **FRC View:** Mass $\to$ Vacuum Consumption $\to$ Pressure Gradient (Inflow) $\to$ Gravity.
      
      What we observe as "Dark Matter" halos is simply the **inflow current** of the vacuum fluid rushing in to feed the galaxy's metabolic coherence.

    stance: "Tully-Fisher"
    answer: |
      CDM struggles to explain the tight correlation between visible matter and rotation speed (the Baryonic Tully-Fisher Relation) without fine-tuning.
      
      In FRC, the "Dark" component is causally linked to the Baryonic component: the inflow (Dark) is determined by the consumption rate of the visible matter (Baryonic). The relation is exact and intrinsic, not accidental.

    by: "FRC"
    stance: "Null"
    answer: |
      After 40 years of direct detection experiments (XENON, LUX, PandaX), no WIMP has been found. FRC predicts this null result will continue forever, because you cannot catch a "current" in a particle trap.

    stance: "Lagrangian vs Statistical"
    answer: |
      Erik Verlinde proposes that gravity is an **Entropic Force** (like the elasticity of a rubber band). It is a statistical effect of information.
      
      FRC provides the **Mechanism** for this effect. While Verlinde describes the *Why* (entropy maximization), FRC describes the *How* (the $\Lambda$-Field Lagrangian). We identify the specific scalar field that carries the entropic information. FRC is to Verlinde what Kinetic Theory is to Thermodynamics: the underlying mechanical reality.

# The River, Not the Rocks

Imagine watching a whirlpool in a river. You see the water spinning faster than it "should" just based on the few rocks in the center.
- **The CDM Scientist** says: "There must be invisible, heavy rocks (Dark Matter) hiding in the water to make it spin that fast."
- **The FRC Scientist** says: "No. The spinning is caused by the *drain* (consumption). The water *is* the gravity."

Galaxies are not static collections of stars; they are dissipative structures. They eat vacuum potential. The "Dark Matter" is just the vacuum rushing in to the dinner table.
