abstract: 'A River-side kitchen physics: fermentation as controlled Nigredo and cooking
  as coherence transfer; why grandmother''s recipe can''t be replicated.'
question: Why does fermentation work, and why can't grandmother's cooking be replicated?
short_answer: 'Fermentation is guided dissolution that produces higher integration
  (new compounds, new coherence). Grandmother''s food contains field factors not in
  the recipe: practiced feedback, microbiome, emotion, and time.'

  answer: 'Treat cooking as coherence transfer: the meal encodes practice, place,
    and feedback loops; industrial food optimizes reproducibility and often loses
    coherence content.'

---# Food: Coherence Alchemy

Cooking is coherence alchemy. Fermentation is controlled Nigredo.

Fermentation through FRC:

Nigredo: raw substrate, intact structure.
Dissolution: microbes break it down; entropy rises locally.
Selection: specific pathways create preservation (acid/alcohol).
Citrinitas: new compounds form that did not exist before.
Rubedo: finished product with higher integration than the raw material.

dS + k·d ln C = 0. The entropy of dissolution balances the coherence of new compounds.

Why grandmother's cooking can't be replicated:

The recipe is the frozen structure. Any machine can follow it. But grandmother's bread contains coherence not in the recipe:

- hands: decades of tactile feedback
- microbiome: unique kitchen ecosystem
- emotional field: attention/care shapes micro-timing and experience
- time: accumulated adjustments across years, altitude, oven quirks, family preferences

Industrial food follows the recipe perfectly and becomes reproducible. But the field is empty.
