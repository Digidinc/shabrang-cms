abstract: "A meaning-first orientation to Fractal Resonance Cognition, with an explicit spectrum: authority-style definitions, FRC framing, and a bridge into the papers."
question: "What is Fractal Resonance Cognition (FRC)?"
short_answer: "FRC is a framework that treats coherence as a real dynamical quantity and uses resonance + fractal scaling to explain how meaning, structure, and measurement-like selection can emerge in complex systems."

    quote: "Entropy is a scientific concept that is most commonly associated with a state of disorder, randomness, or uncertainty."

    stance: "meaning-first"
    answer: "FRC is a map of how the universe organizes attention: coherence is the felt alignment of phases across scales, entropy is the cost of that alignment, and resonance is the mechanism of selection."

    answer: "If standard models treat probability as fundamental, FRC treats probability as a surface symptom of deeper resonant attractor dynamics. The goal is not mysticism, but a deterministic scaffold for collapse-like selection, learning, and cognition."

# What is FRC?

FRC is published in multiple forms:

- **Papers**: the formal research archive.
- **Books**: long-form expositions.
- **Articles**: bridges and commentary.
- **Topics**: a digestible Q&A spectrum.

## Where To Start

- If you want equations and definitions, start from the **Kasra** side and read the early papers.
- If you want orientation and meaning, read from the **River** side and use Topics as an entry ramp.

## Notes

This page is intentionally an overview. It should evolve as the corpus grows.
