abstract: A concise, rigorous orientation to Fractal Resonance Cognition (FRC), with
  definitions, citations, and links into the core papers.
question: What is Fractal Resonance Cognition (FRC)?
short_answer: FRC is a framework that treats coherence as a real dynamical quantity
  and uses resonance + fractal scaling to explain how meaning, structure, and measurement-like
  selection can emerge in complex systems.

  quote: In physics, coherence describes the correlation between physical quantities
    of a wave.

  title: Entropy
  url: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy
  quote: Entropy is a scientific concept that is most commonly associated with a state
    of disorder, randomness, or uncertainty.

  role: Overview
  stance: rigorous
  answer: FRC treats coherence as a state variable that can be modeled dynamically,
    and uses reciprocity constraints (entropy ↔ coherence) to connect thermodynamic
    bookkeeping with selection-like behavior in open systems.

  answer: Start with the reciprocity law and the Λ-field derivations, then use Topics
    as a stable index of definitions, comparisons, and open problems.

---# What is FRC?

FRC is published in multiple forms:

- **Papers**: the formal research archive.
- **Books**: long-form expositions.
- **Articles**: bridges and commentary.
- **Topics**: a digestible Q&A spectrum.

## Where To Start

- For equations and definitions, start from the papers:
  - [[FRC-566-001|Reciprocity]]
  - [[FRC-100-007|Λ-field and predictions]]
  - [[FRC-821-100|Λ-field EFT]]

## Notes

This page is intentionally an overview. It should evolve as the corpus grows.
