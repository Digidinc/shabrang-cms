title: "FRC vs. Random Mutation (Neo-Darwinism)"
question: "Can random mutation alone explain the speed of evolution?"
short_answer: "FRC suggests that evolution is accelerated by 'Resonant Search.' Biology uses the Lambda-field to 'tunnel' through the fitness landscape, finding coherent solutions faster than random chance allows."

      The space of possible proteins is too vast ($20^{300}$) to search randomly. Yet life finds functional proteins constantly.
      
      FRC proposes that the fitness landscape is not flat; it is shaped by the Lambda-field. "Good" biological forms (high coherence) are **attractors** in the field. Life doesn't just stumble upon them; it falls into them.

    answer: |
      Biological mutations that increase internal coherence ($dC > 0$) are energetically favored by the Lambda-field gradient. This acts as a "pre-selection" filter, discarding incoherent mutations before they even manifest as phenotypes. Evolution is "rigged" in favor of order.

    stance: "Geometric"
    answer: |
      This is not "Intelligent Design" (a God intervening). It is **Geometric Design**. The laws of physics themselves favor the emergence of complexity because complexity maximizes the rate of entropy production (Metabolic Gravity). Life is the most efficient way for the universe to eat.

# The Resonant Watchmaker

The "Blind Watchmaker" argument says that given enough time, randomness creates eyes.
FRC says: "You don't have enough time."

To explain the explosion of life (Cambrian Explosion), you need an accelerator. That accelerator is **Resonance**.
Just as a radio tunes into a signal, biological molecules tune into the "Coherence Channels" of the vacuum. Evolution is not just survival of the fittest; it is **survival of the most resonant**.
