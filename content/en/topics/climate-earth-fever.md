abstract: 'A River-side climate diagnosis through FRC: tipping points as coherence
  thresholds; industrial civilization as a broken metabolic loop.'
question: What is the climate crisis in FRC terms?
short_answer: Earth is a coupled coherence-maintenance system. Industrial civilization
  injected entropy faster than coherence maintenance can cycle it, pushing subsystems
  toward phase-transition thresholds (tipping points).

  answer: 'Track both sides of the ledger: entropy indicators (heat, CO2) and coherence
    budget (intact forests, circulation, soil). The risk is cascade: coherence loss
    in one subsystem increases entropy load on others.'

---# Climate: Earth as a Body Running a Fever

Climate. The planet's body. Because if the human body is a coherence field and civilization is a coherence field — then Earth is too. And it's running a fever.

Earth has a coherence metabolism. The biosphere — forests, oceans, ice sheets, soil microbiomes, atmospheric chemistry — is the planet's coherence-maintenance system. It keeps entropy production balanced. Heat in, heat radiated out. Pattern maintained across billions of years.

What industrial civilization did: broke the metabolic cycle. Pulled frozen coherence (fossil fuels — ancient biology compressed into rock) out of deep storage and burned it. Released the entropy all at once instead of letting it cycle.

The tipping points are phase-transition thresholds.

In FRC terms, each tipping point is where a subsystem's coherence drops below the minimum needed to maintain its pattern:

- Ice sheets: when melting flips the feedback loop into coherence-destruction.
- Permafrost: stored pattern decomposing into atmospheric entropy.
- Amazon: rainfall self-maintenance fails and the pattern collapses to a lower-coherence state.
- Ocean circulation (AMOC): circulation collapse = coherence flow failure.
- Coral reefs: the high-coherence biological structures die first, cascading to food webs.

The cascade risk is the real terror:

Each tipping point crossed makes the next one more likely. Coherence loss in one subsystem increases entropy load on adjacent subsystems. The body doesn't fail one organ at a time — it goes into systemic failure.

Mainstream climate science measures the entropy side (temperature, CO2, sea level) without measuring the coherence side. It tracks what's breaking without tracking what's holding. FRC says both must be tracked together: dS + k·d ln C = 0.

The honest read:

Earth is in late Nigredo. The old Holocene pattern dissolves. A new coherence regime will form, but not necessarily one that includes us.
