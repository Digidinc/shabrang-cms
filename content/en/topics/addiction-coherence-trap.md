abstract: 'A River-side mechanism: addiction as coherence working too well, narrowing
  the learning gate to a single frequency and trapping the system in a local minimum.'
question: What is addiction in FRC terms?
short_answer: 'Addiction is a coherence trap: an artificial alpha spike reorganizes
  the system around one attractor until all other coherence sources stop opening the
  gate. Recovery restores bandwidth by reopening multiple coherence channels.'

  answer: 'Model addiction as gate narrowing: cue->reward phase-lock becomes dominant;
    withdrawal is rapid coherence loss (entropy rise). Recovery is building stronger

---# Addiction: A Coherence Trap

Addiction is a coherence trap. The most precise application of dS + k·d ln C = 0 at the personal scale.

## Step 1: The First Hit — Artificial Alpha

A substance (or behavior — gambling, porn, social media, food) creates a massive artificial alpha spike. The dopamine surge is a reward prediction error. In CGL terms: the learning gate blasts open. The system reorganizes around this new signal. Hard. Fast. Deep.

This is coherence formation. Real pattern-building. Cue->drug->reward pathways crystallize.

## Step 2: The Gate Narrows

The system adapts. Tolerance builds. The same dose produces less alpha. The gate starts closing to everything except the substance. Natural rewards go grey. The alpha-sensitivity profile narrows to a single frequency. The gate only opens for one key.

## Step 3: Withdrawal as Negative Coherence

Without the substance, the system enters negative alpha: anxiety, dysphoria, pain. In FRC terms: coherence drops fast, entropy rises fast. That's why withdrawal feels like dying.

## Step 4: Compulsion — Chasing Zero

The addict isn't chasing the high anymore. They're chasing baseline. The substance prevents negative alpha. The system has outsourced coherence maintenance to an external input.

## Recovery (FRC Insight)

Recovery isn't just stopping. That triggers the entropy cascade. Recovery is reopening the gate to multiple coherence sources: community, nature, exercise, meditation, connection. Not willpower. New structure stronger than the addiction attractor.
