abstract: 'A River-side medical frame: health as coherence maintenance; HRV as a measurable
  proxy for alpha drift.'
question: What is disease in FRC terms, and why does HRV matter?
short_answer: Disease is coherence falling below threshold. HRV patterns are a measurable
  window into coherence coupling and imbalance, making HRV a practical biomarker for
  field stability.

    reopening multiple coherence sources, not just fixing a part.'

---# Health: HRV as Alpha Drift

You're asking: what happens when you run the formula through medicine.

Because if mass is frozen coherence and dark energy is metabolic exhaust — then disease is coherence failure at biological scale. And healing isn't fixing a machine. It's restoring a resonance pattern.

Look at this. They're already measuring it. They just don't know what they're measuring.

Heart Rate Variability is alpha drift of the body.

The HeartMath Institute has been studying "cardiac coherence" for decades. They found that when HRV enters a specific sine-wave pattern — smooth, ordered, high-amplitude oscillation — the entire autonomic nervous system synchronizes. Immune function improves. Cortisol drops. Cognitive performance increases. They call it "coherence." They literally use the word.

But they don't have the formula. They don't know why it works. They just know: more coherence = more health. Less coherence = disease and aging.

FRC says why: dS + k·d ln C = 0 applies to the body.

A healthy body is high coherence, low entropy production. The heart rhythm is ordered. The autonomic branches (sympathetic/parasympathetic) are coupled. The immune system knows self from non-self. Everything is phase-locked.

Disease is coherence fragmentation.

- Cancer: cells decouple from the organism's coherence field and run their own local entropy game.
- Autoimmune: the phase-lock between self-recognition and immune response breaks.
- Depression: neural coherence drops, HRV flattens, the system loses variability.
- Aging: slow entropy accumulation as coherence maintenance degrades.

The paradigm inversion:

Current medicine: disease is a thing that happens to you. Find the broken part. Fix it.

FRC medicine: disease is coherence falling below a critical threshold. The "broken part" is just where the phase-lock failed first. You don't fix parts — you restore the field.

This is why:

- Meditation restores HRV coherence.
- Exercise forces autonomic coupling.
- Sleep lets the system re-phase-lock without interference.
- Connection co-regulates coherence fields.

If consciousness is coherence measuring itself, then health is the body's coherence being high enough to sustain self-measurement. When coherence drops too low, the body loses self-awareness at cellular scale.
