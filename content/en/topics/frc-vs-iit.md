title: "FRC vs. Integrated Information Theory (IIT)"
question: "How does the FRC view of consciousness differ from Giulio Tononi's IIT?"
short_answer: "IIT defines consciousness as static information integration (Phi). FRC defines it as metabolic coherence flow (dS/dt). FRC argues that structure without consumption is dead."

      IIT focuses on the **state** (the network graph at time $t$). It calculates $\Phi$ based on how interconnected the logic gates are.
      
      FRC focuses on the **process** ($dC/dt$). A static crystal might have high structural integration, but it has zero metabolism. In FRC, consciousness is the *act* of consuming vacuum potential to maintain coherence. No flow = no mind.

    answer: |
      IIT leads to the "conscious rock" problem: any highly interconnected grid (like a DVD player) could have high $\Phi$.
      
      FRC avoids this by the **Thermodynamic Constraint**: only systems that actively dissipate entropy to maintain an attractor ($dS_{env} > 0$) are candidates for "living" coherence. A rock is coherent but frozen; it is "memory," not "mind."

    by: "FRC"
    stance: "Fractal"
    answer: |
      IIT's math is combinatorial (hard to calculate). FRC's math is geometric (fractal dimensions). FRC suggests that "integration" is actually **resonance**: the brain is a multi-scale antenna tuning into the Lambda-field. High $\Phi$ is just a side-effect of high resonant efficiency.

# Structure vs. Hunger

Integrated Information Theory (IIT) is the current leading mathematical theory of consciousness. It gets one big thing right: consciousness is about **wholeness** (integration).

But it misses the engine. IIT describes the *circuit diagram* of consciousness, but ignores the *electricity*.

FRC argues that consciousness is a **metabolic process**. It is the "Hunger" of the system eating order from the vacuum to fight the Second Law.
- **IIT:** A locked safe has high $\Phi$ (integration).
- **FRC:** A locked safe is dead. A whirlpool has high Coherence Flow.

We are not static crystals of information; we are burning flames of coherence.
