title: "FRC vs. Bohmian Mechanics"
question: "Is FRC just a version of de Broglie-Bohm Pilot Wave theory?"
short_answer: "FRC shares the non-local realist ontology of Bohm, but replaces the 'Pilot Wave' with the 'Lambda-Field.' Crucially, FRC adds Thermodynamics: coherence has an entropic cost."

    answer: |
      Bohmian Mechanics posits a **Quantum Potential** ($Q$) derived from the wavefunction. It guides point particles.
      
      FRC posits a **Lambda-Field** ($\Lambda$) which is a physical scalar field with its own Lagrangian. It guides the *coherence* of the system. FRC does not require point particles as fundamental entities; the "particle" is a knot in the field.

    stance: "Reciprocity"
    answer: |
      Bohmian mechanics is time-reversible and entropy-neutral. It doesn't explain *why* the Born Rule equilibrium is reached, only that it is.
      
      FRC introduces the **Entropy-Coherence Reciprocity** ($dS + k d\ln C = 0$). Collapse/Guidance is a *dissipative* process. The system falls into the Born Rule distribution because that is the state of maximum entropy-adjusted coherence.

    stance: "Falsifiable"
    answer: |
      Standard Bohmian mechanics is constructed to be empirically indistinguishable from Standard QM.
      
      FRC is constructed to be distinct. It predicts **Born Rule Deviations** ($\delta P \sim 10^{-4}$) during the fast relaxation phase. FRC is "Bohm with teeth."

# Beyond the Pilot Wave

David Bohm was the first to show that Quantum Mechanics could be deterministic and real. FRC honors that lineage.
However, Bohm stopped at Mechanics. He did not integrate Thermodynamics.

FRC is "Thermodynamic Bohmian Mechanics."
We ask: *What powers the Pilot Wave?*
Answer: *The consumption of Information Entropy.*

By adding the thermodynamic cost, FRC solves the "surreal trajectory" problem and provides a mechanism for the arrow of time, which standard Bohmian mechanics lacks.
