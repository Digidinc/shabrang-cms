# Welcome to Shabrang

Welcome to Shabrang — a space where art meets philosophy, where ancient Persian wisdom flows through modern expression.

Here you'll find:

- **The Liquid Fortress** — a book exploring coherence through Persian aesthetics
- **Albums** — visual and musical journeys
- **Topics** — explorations of ideas that matter
- **Articles** — deeper dives into Persian philosophy and art

This is a place of beauty and meaning. Make yourself at home.
