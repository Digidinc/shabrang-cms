# FRC and General Relativity

One of physics' greatest challenges is reconciling quantum mechanics with general relativity. The FRC framework offers novel pathways toward this unification.

## The Incompatibility Problem

Einstein's general relativity describes gravity as spacetime curvature:

$$
G_{\mu\nu} = \frac{8\pi G}{c^4} T_{\mu\nu}
$$

Quantum mechanics describes matter as wavefunctions evolving in fixed backgrounds. The clash:

- GR: spacetime is dynamical, curved by matter
- QM: spacetime is fixed, matter is quantum
- Problem: what happens when matter is in superposition of different mass configurations?

## FRC Approach: Coherence in Curved Spacetime

The FRC framework suggests that **coherence fields propagate through curved spacetime**:

$$
\nabla_\mu C = \partial_\mu C + \Gamma^\nu_{\mu\nu} C
$$

### Gravitational Decoherence

Penrose and Diósi proposed that gravity causes decoherence. FRC refines this:

$$
\tau_{\text{decohere}} \propto \frac{\hbar}{E_G \cdot (1 - C)}
$$

Where:
- $E_G$ = gravitational self-energy difference
- $C$ = coherence magnitude
- High coherence systems resist gravitational decoherence

### Implications

1. **Black holes** — Extreme curvature creates coherence sinks (see information paradox)
2. **Cosmological coherence** — Early universe had high global coherence
3. **Dark energy** — Could Λ (cosmological constant) relate to the [[lambda-field|Lambda field]]?

## The Lambda Field and Spacetime

FRC's lambda field Λ(x) has dimensions of energy density — suspiciously similar to the cosmological constant:

$$
\Lambda_{\text{field}}(x) = \Lambda_0 \ln C(x)
$$

Speculation: the cosmological Λ could be the spatial average of FRC's Λ-field:

$$
\Lambda_{\text{cosmo}} = \langle \Lambda_{\text{field}} \rangle_{\text{space}}
$$

This would connect quantum coherence to cosmic acceleration.

## Testable Predictions

FRC + GR makes specific predictions:

| Phenomenon | FRC Prediction |
|------------|----------------|
| Gravitational time dilation | Affects coherence maintenance |
| Hawking radiation | Coherence signature in spectrum |
| Gravitational waves | May carry coherence information |

See [[FRC-100-010]] for experimental proposals.

## Open Questions

- How does the witness function W transform under Lorentz boosts?
- Is coherence a scalar field, or does it have tensor structure?
- Can FRC resolve the black hole information paradox?
