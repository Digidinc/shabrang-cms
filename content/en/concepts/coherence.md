# Coherence (C)

A dimensionless scalar gauge measuring the degree of internal order or pattern-locking in a system.

## Definition

In the FRC framework, coherence C is defined through its reciprocal relationship with entropy:

```
S + k* ln C = const.
```

Where k* is the coherence constant (1 in information layers, k_B in thermodynamic layers).

## Properties

- **Dimensionless** — pure ratio, no units
- **Bounded** — C in (0, 1] for normalized systems
- **Reciprocal to entropy** — as S increases, C decreases (and vice versa)
- **Gauge-invariant** — only ratios C_1/C_2 are physically meaningful
