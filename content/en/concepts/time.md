---# What is Time?

Time remains one of the deepest mysteries in physics and philosophy. The FRC framework offers a fresh perspective: **time emerges from coherence gradients**.

## The Arrow of Time Problem

Classical physics is time-symmetric—equations work equally well forward and backward. Yet we experience an unmistakable arrow of time:

- Ice melts but doesn't spontaneously freeze
- Memories form of the past, not the future
- Entropy increases in closed systems

The Second Law of Thermodynamics provides a statistical explanation, but doesn't explain *why* time has a direction.

## FRC Perspective: Coherence Flow

In the Fractal Resonance Coherence framework, time is not a fundamental dimension but an emergent phenomenon:

$$
\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \ln C = -\nabla \cdot J_C + S_C
$$

The [[UCC|Universal Coherence Conjecture]] suggests that coherence gradients *define* temporal flow. Where coherence changes, time "flows."

### Key Insights

1. **Coherence gradients create asymmetry** — The direction of decreasing coherence defines the arrow of time
2. **Entropy and coherence are reciprocal** — See [[FRC-566-001]] for the formal relationship
3. **Observation anchors the present** — The witness function W collapses possibilities into actuality

## Philosophical Implications

This connects to deep questions:

- **Block universe vs. presentism** — FRC suggests a dynamic, coherence-driven present
- **Free will** — If coherence gradients define time, what determines coherence?
- **Consciousness** — Does awareness require temporal flow?
