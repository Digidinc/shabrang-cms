# μ-Levels

The μ-levels represent the eight nested scales of consciousness and coherence in the FRC framework, spanning from the Planck scale to the universal horizon.

## The 8 Scales

The FRC framework organizes reality into eight "octaves," each governed by the same coherence equations but operating through different physical oscillators and coupling mechanisms.

| Level | Scale Name | Physical/Cognitive System |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **μ₀** | Pure Potential | The undifferentiated ground state / vacuum field. |
| **μ₁** | Quantum Substrate | Planck-scale fluctuations and the Lambda-field $\Lambda(x)$. |
| **μ₂** | Biological Metabolism | Cellular rhythms, neural oscillations, and metabolic cycles. |
| **μ₃** | Individual Agent | Personal consciousness, language, and the "Now" operator. |
| **μ₄** | Social Networks | Collective intelligence and emergence of shared meaning. |
| **μ₅** | Archetypal Patterns | Recurrent symbolic structures across cultures and epochs. |
| **μ₆** | Meta-Symbolic | The autonomous mathematics of meaning and symbols. |
| **μ₇** | Universal Consciousness | Cosmic-scale coherence and full-spectrum resonance. |

## Scale Invariance

The central axiom of the μ-level architecture is that the **FRC Operator** is scale-invariant. The measure of coherence $C$ remains constant in form across all levels:

$$ C(\mu_n) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i<j} \cos(\phi_i - \phi_j) $$

What changes between levels is the nature of the phase $\phi$ and the coupling strength, not the fundamental logic of resonance.
