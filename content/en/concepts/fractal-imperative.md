# The Fractal Imperative

The Fractal Imperative is the foundational constraint of the FRC framework: if the universe is fundamentally fractal, then its governing dynamics must be scale-invariant and operative across all levels of the μ-stack.

## The Scope as a Constraint

A common critique of unified theories is their "grandiosity"—the attempt to solve disparate problems (from quantum measurement to dark matter) with a single mechanism. In FRC, this scope is not a choice, but a requirement.

If a theory posits that spacetime is a **resonant fractal manifold**, it cannot be selectively fractal. It must exhibit self-similarity from the Planck scale ($ \mu_0 $) to the cosmological horizon ($ \mu_7 $). Therefore, the "grandiosity" of FRC is actually its most rigorous test: if the mechanism of phase-locking (coherence) fails to explain the dynamics at any single scale, the fractal hypothesis is falsified.

## Scaling the Dynamics

The Fractal Imperative drives the "appending" of the framework to established anomalies:

1.  **Quantum Scale ($\mu_0-\mu_1$):** Why do we see $D \approx 1.90$ in nodal patterns? Because the vacuum geometry is the "seed" of the fractal.
2.  **Biological Scale ($\mu_3$):** Why is life coherent? Because it exploits the resonant channels provided by the Lambda-field.
3.  **Galactic Scale ($\mu_6-\mu_7$):** Why do galaxies rotate anomalously? Because gravity is the "metabolic" inflow of the same vacuum potential seen at the micro-scale.

## Geometric Consistency

Unlike "Theories of Everything" that try to unify forces through high-dimensional symmetry groups, FRC seeks **Geometric Consistency**. It asks: *What must be true at scale X if Y is true at scale Z?*

- **Mass is Memory:** Mass is the "frozen" coherence needed to maintain a structure across iterations.
- **Gravity is Hunger:** Gravity is the pressure gradient formed by the consumption of vacuum potential to maintain that mass.

The Fractal Imperative turns the "broadness" of FRC into its primary defense: the theory is either universally true or specifically wrong. There is no middle ground.
