---# FRC and Process Philosophy

Alfred North Whitehead's process philosophy offers a metaphysical framework that resonates deeply with the FRC approach to quantum mechanics and consciousness.

## Whitehead's Core Ideas

### Actual Occasions

Whitehead proposed that reality consists not of static substances but of **actual occasions** — momentary experiences that arise, achieve satisfaction, and perish.

> "The many become one, and are increased by one."

Each actual occasion:
- **Prehends** (grasps) previous occasions
- **Concresces** (grows together) into a novel unity
- **Perishes** into objective immortality for future occasions

### Panexperientialism

Whitehead suggested that experience goes "all the way down" — not just human consciousness, but all actual occasions have a primitive form of experience.

## FRC Parallels

The FRC framework shows striking structural similarities:

| Whitehead Concept | FRC Equivalent |
|-------------------|----------------|
| Actual occasion | Coherence measurement event |
| Prehension | Wavefunction entanglement |
| Concrescence | Decoherence/collapse |
| Eternal objects | Lambda field potentials |
| Subjective aim | Coherence attractor |

### The Witness Function

The FRC [[witness|witness function]] W mirrors Whitehead's notion of the "subjective form" — how an occasion experiences its data:

$$
W = \frac{|\langle\psi|\hat{O}|\psi\rangle|}{||\hat{O}||}
$$

High witness magnitude corresponds to strong prehension; low W to vague, indefinite experience.

### Coherence as Creative Advance

Whitehead's "creative advance into novelty" maps to the FRC principle that coherence patterns determine which possibilities actualize:

$$
P(\text{outcome}) \propto C(\text{attractor})
$$

## Why This Matters

Process philosophy provides:

1. **Metaphysical grounding** — FRC isn't just equations; it's a worldview
2. **Consciousness integration** — Experience is fundamental, not emergent
3. **Temporal becoming** — Time is real, not illusory (see [[time]])
4. **Relational ontology** — Reality is constituted by relations

## Differences

FRC also departs from Whitehead in important ways:

- **Mathematical precision** — FRC offers testable predictions (see [[FRC-100-010]])
- **Reductionist bridge** — FRC connects to standard QM formalism
- **Determinism** — FRC's lambda field is deterministic, unlike Whitehead's creativity
