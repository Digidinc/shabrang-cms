# Witness Function (W)

In FRC, the witness `W` is used as a normalized measure of observation strength.
It is a way to talk about how strongly a system is being "witnessed" (measured,
coupled to an environment, or otherwise constrained).

## Definition (normalized magnitude)

```
W = |<psi|O|psi>| / ||O||
```

## Notes

- `W` is typically treated as bounded in `[0, 1]` by construction.
- `W` is referenced when discussing collapse/selection dynamics.
