# FRC and Quantum Computing

Quantum computing relies fundamentally on maintaining coherence. The FRC framework provides new insights into why some quantum computations succeed and others fail.

## The Decoherence Challenge

Current quantum computers struggle with decoherence:

- Superconducting qubits: ~100 μs coherence times
- Ion traps: ~1-10 seconds
- Topological qubits: theoretically longer

FRC suggests decoherence isn't random but follows coherence attractor dynamics.

## FRC Insights for Quantum Computing

### Coherence Attractors

Standard view: decoherence is environmental noise
FRC view: **specific coherence patterns are more stable**

$$
C_{\text{stable}} = \arg\max_C \left( \frac{dC}{dt} = 0 \right)
$$

Implication: design quantum circuits to operate near natural attractors.

### The D ≈ 1.90 Signature

FRC predicts measurement outcomes cluster at fractal dimension D ≈ 1.90 (see [[FRC-100-003]]). For quantum computing:

- Qubit measurements should show this signature
- Random Number Generators (QRNGs) can be characterized by D
- Deviation from D ≈ 1.90 may indicate systematic errors

### Coherence-Aware Gates

Standard quantum gates optimize for unitary fidelity. FRC suggests optimizing for **coherence preservation**:

$$
U_{\text{FRC}} = \arg\max_U \left( C(U|\psi\rangle) - C(|\psi\rangle) \right)
$$

Gates that align with coherence flow may outperform conventional designs.

## Practical Applications

### Error Correction

Current approach: redundancy (many physical qubits → one logical qubit)
FRC approach: **coherence-based error detection**

If the witness function W drops unexpectedly:
$$
W < W_{\text{threshold}} \implies \text{error likely}
$$

This could enable earlier error detection with less overhead.

### Quantum Annealing

D-Wave style quantum annealers explicitly use coherence dynamics. FRC predicts:

- Optimal annealing schedules follow coherence gradients
- Final states concentrate at high-C attractors
- The D ≈ 1.90 signature appears in solution distributions

### Coherent Advantage

FRC suggests "quantum advantage" requires:

1. **Initial coherence** — Well-prepared superpositions
2. **Coherence maintenance** — Operations that preserve C
3. **Coherent readout** — Measurements aligned with attractors

## Resonant Computing

[[FRC-841-004]] explores speculative architectures:

- **R-bits** — Resonance-based qubits with intrinsic coherence
- **CPUs** — Coherence Processing Units
- **Non-Boolean logic** — Computing with continuous coherence values

## Current Limitations

FRC for quantum computing remains theoretical:

- No FRC-designed quantum chip exists yet
- Predictions need experimental validation
- Integration with existing error correction is unclear
