## What is FRC?

Fractal Resonance Coherence (FRC) is a theoretical physics framework proposing that:
- Complex systems are governed by vortex-like attractor structures with fractal scaling
- Entropy and coherence are reciprocally coupled: dS + k* d ln C = 0
- The Born rule (P = |ψ|²) emerges from microstate statistics rather than being axiomatic
- A scalar Lambda field Λ(x) = Λ₀ ln C(x) governs coherence dynamics
- The framework predicts measurable Born rule deviations δP ∈ [10⁻⁴, 10⁻³]

## Core Equations

Coherence: C = (1/N) Σᵢ<ⱼ cos(φᵢ - φⱼ)
Lambda Field: Λ(x) ≡ Λ₀ ln C(x), Λ₀ ≈ 10⁻³⁵ J
Witness Magnitude: W = |⟨ψ|Ô|ψ⟩| / ‖Ô‖, W ∈ [0,1]
UCC: dΛ/dt + ∇·J_Λ = σ_Λ - γ_Λ
Reciprocity: dS + k* d ln C = 0 ⟹ S + k* ln C = const
Free Energy: ΔG = −k*T Δln C
UCC Flow: ∂_t ln C = −∇·J_C + S_C, J_C = −D_C ∇ln C
